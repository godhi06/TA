christineyvette; So I get very depressed during my period (which started last Wednesday and ended yesterday) so I have many panic attacks, sleep a lot, cry and just feel very low so that's normal. I'm been in my room for 7 days. Secluded. Only leaving to use the bathroom and to eat (not much because I can't eat with my anxiety) and I haven't interacted with anyone in my family or even spoken to anyone. They know to leave me be until it passes. It also doesn't help that the one person who helps, my mom, is currently not speaking to me. I need her. I'm now having really bad derealization. I've had it before but this time it's SO bad. Is this because I have been having so many panic attacks and just laying in bed and not being social? My bathroom and kitchen look so foreign to me. I'm scared. I tried to take a nap and I woke up after a hour and my heart was POUNDING and I was sweating and panting and had the worse panic attack. I felt like I wasn't here. It was scary. I've have derealization many times before b t not this bad. I even contemplated going to the ER cause i'm scared i'm having a stroke or it's a brain tumor. I tried talking to my cats and feeding them treats but it feel so wierd, like not real. I took a shower for the first time in a couple days two nights ago and I felt a bit better there. I've been searching if I have cancer, or tumors or a stroke and i'm terrified. I also went without my diazepam for 24 hours due to my perscription running out. I got it back today. I take 5mg twice daily. Did that mess me up? It's 4am and i'm so scared.;
christineyvette; I’m in Canada and it’s thanksgiving. I would give anything to be in my bed right now but I’m doing this to make my family happy. I’m going to dinner an hour away from home and I have no appetite (from said anxiety) and im feeling the nerves. Fuck.;
christineyvette; For me it’s been since I was 8. I’m 27 now. It kind of scares me. They do work immensely though.;
christineyvette; Does anyone get in the mindset that you KNOW you'll feel better if you take a shower, get out of bed, get some fresh air, call a friend and just talk but....you just can't? Ugh.;
christineyvette; I feel like i'm the only one.;
christineyvette; I keep saying that tomorrow I will get out of my room. I will take a walk or do something to keep my mind busy instead of laying in bed and watching Netflix and reading articles. Then the next day comes and the anxiety and the fear kicks in. These days are passing me by and i'm getting more and more fed up. I don't know what's wrong with me. I need out of this prison that is my mind and never ending spiralling thoughts;
christineyvette; I was diagnosed with panic related agoraphobia a decade ago but it wasn't as bad as this past year when I experienced the worst panic attack of my life. It spiraled into health anxiety and trips to the ER for my panic attacks, self harm relapses ect. Then I had family stress added on top of it. I haven't left the house in almost a month and that was just to the pharmacy and I was anxious and out of it with derealization the whole time. Only wanted to get back home. I have a fear of being anxious in public. I can't handle it. Anyone else?;
christineyvette; I then get worried that the anxiety will prevent me from ever being hungry again then i'll get malnourished and then my organs will shut down. It sucks.;
christineyvette; I'm overwhelmed, having constant panic attacks. I just want to be asleep where I can't feel anything. I slept until 6pm. I haven't eaten in over 12 hours. I have no desire too. I'm drinking water. I have no energy to go downstairs and talk to anyone. I don't want anyone to bother me in my room. I'm not fighting it this time. It's gonna take over and i'm gonna let it. I'm just gonna lay here in bed on Netflix and playing games on my phone until it's time to take my sleeping pills again and sleep all day. Then dread to wake up and do it again. I'm tired of trying. My soul is tired.;
christineyvette; Slept till 5pm and then just laid here. I know If I move, the anxiety will start. fuck this;
christineyvette; I have a severe anxiety and panic disorder. It makes me super aware of my throat and I feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up. I also have GERD. This past year i've relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed. I'm working on therapy after the New Year. I don't know if it's my head but I am SUPER aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag. I don't know if this is my anxiety or GERD or even both but it's incredibly frustrating. Last winter I saw my doctor and I was gagging so bad in his office that I could barely talk. He prescribed me Rabeprazole and so I took it for a month or two and then stopped. Not sure why. The gagging is back though and so today I took one. I'm hoping it does something and I'm just thinking it's my anxiety and my head concentrating too much. It's just frustrating because it's hard to eat. I'll be scared of eating and then gag. Ugh. Hopefully this made sense.;
christineyvette; I have severe anxiety and it blew up into really bad agoraphobia in the past year and a half. I spend 99% of my time confined in my room and with barely any social interaction. I don't work and am on disability. I've had dp/dr a few times before when my panic attacks get really bad but lately I think its different? Like a smell or a tv show or something from a memory of my past, will trigger the disconnected feeling and like i'm back in that memory. The memory isn't even particularity traumatic. I sometimes will watch tv or a movie and I feel like i'm the character and then I start panicking and then that triggers the dp/dr. I feel like i'm gonna go crazy. I'm scared. What is this? It it caused from my mind being idle and literally doing nothing but watching Netflix 20 hours a day? My panic attacks are ruthless because I don't feel like myself at all.;
paladin_omega78; Long story short : rejected at interview after interview, fresh off uni, got dumped (bad breakup), get bad dreams every night, football team not doing well, the list can go on and on. It's been the same way for almost a year now (probably more). Don't want to post to any public media for fear of...well idk. SO posting here. I know this is probably less than what most face, and I'm sorry for writing it out like this. But my close friends think i need help. And Reddit has always been there for me. It's possible to bounce back, right? Because most days I can't even get the strength to get out of bed and talk to anyone. Alcohol and pot give me company, but this can't just go on like this. Just need some positivity. Any suggestions?;
paladin_omega78; I've been diagnosed with clinical depression a few months before and whatever I've tried, it has gotten worse. Had an interview call from a company I really wanted to join in London, but after the interview I gave, almost no hopes of a call back. Adding to that, a recent breakup (had a 2 year relationship with a girl I thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with), football team sucking balls as usual, parental pressure, etc. etc.;
paladin_omega78; Self-explanatory I guess. I'm just venting here, dunno what else to do. Graduated from a top-20 university last year, thought it'll finally get better. Quite the opposite, in fact. Had a pretty messy breakup with a girl who I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with, worked in a startup for a bit but absolutely hated it, so left and came back home to London. Living with parents is so much worse than I initially thought. Ended up going to therapy but that didn't help either.;
paladin_omega78; Well, the title is self-explanatory. I dunno, kinda gives me solace to think that there is, somewhere, a version of me who's doing much better in life and hopefully for him, doesn't have crippling anxiety or depression. It's also rather disconcerting if we think deeply about it.;
paladin_omega78; 2019 was quite simply, the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with clinical depression late 2017, but the problems surmounted the past year. Came back home after graduating, thought things would finally change. But..bad breakup with the love of my life, unemployment and repeated repeated rejections, problems at home, had a ligament tear....it goes on and on. Wanted to start afresh the new decade, but it just plummeted lower and lower. Interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still haven't been gotten back to, so I think that's that- my last chance at some redemption is gone, im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment. Been shutting myself off everything, but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going. We were on the terrace smoking a fag, and at a time it was only me there. Then all the pent-up frustration let loose. All the failures had taken a toll, and I broke down. Went to the edge, said some words and was just ABOUT to jump when I saw s mething flash by me. A white trail of light. Wasn't a bird, or paper, or anything. My mind became even more blank but instead of jumping, I staggered back and fell back on the floor.;
cornergoddess; I'm 13 and I haven't cut in 7 months. My scars are starting to fade and it makes me want to make new ones. If the scars fade, it's like it never really happened. What do I do?;
cornergoddess; I haven't cut in eight months, but I find myself wanting to again. I'll look at sad pictures just to make myself cry. I'm really close. I don't want to. Or do I? I don't know anymore. My parents will be extremely mad. My friends will yell at me. What do I do. Help. Edit: does a push pin count as cutting? If so, I broke my streak.;
cornergoddess; I'm 13 and I have been hearing thought-like voices for some time now. I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and am on Zoloft. I have a therapist too. I also cut. The voice curses a lot and tells me that I'm worthless and stupid. I can't stop it talking once it starts; it only goes away when it wants. Als
o, I wish on everything and strongly believe it will come true, and I get mad at the 'wish gods' or 'stars' when they don't. My question is, do I have some kind of scitzoaffective or schizophrenic disorder. If there are any further questions, feel free to ask me.;;
cornergoddess; Okay, so I'm a teenager with Asperger's, depression, and social anxiety. My mother, as far as I can tell, does everything she's supposed to. So why do I cringe every time she touches me? Why can't I find any emotional attachment for her? I love my dad and my brother, just not her. I don't know what's wrong with me.;
sugarallie;" One of my friends lost his brother to suicide 20 years ago and has still not completely dealt with/""gotten over"" (I hate using that term with reference to someone/something that has died) it. My depression has become significantly increased in the last 4 months or so, and my friend has noticed this. He told me one day, with as serious of a look on his face and tone in his voice that I've ever seen, that if I ever try to kill myself and he finds out about it, he will cut me out of his life for good. Completely cut off communication with me, never want to see me again.";
sugarallie; i feel so raw. i feel like a walking wound. i never stop hurting and the slightest emotional brushes open everything back up. my emotions are so strong they will kill me one day if i let them. everything hurts me. i'm too sensitive. OVERLY sensitive. i get overwhelmed at almost nothing;
Johnnys_thinkgs; What is the worst side effect of medication treatment you have experianced?;
Johnnys_thinkgs; What can i do to make up for a friend after a have been an asshole? it's her birthday in a few days pleease heelp mee, i want to give her a gift btw;
Johnnys_thinkgs; People with mental disorder what are the side-effects of your disorder? Physiological or psycological?;
KeepYourClawsOut; This new medication, Wellbutrin, has me moving in my sleep a lot. I've kicked my legs when I was covered in bugs. Punched my partner when I was actually punching my step dad. Last night I dreamed of my ex. I came home for the day and I was excited to see him. I ran up and tried to give him a hug and he stopped me. I asked why I couldn't hug him and he said he didn't want to and continued walking.;
KeepYourClawsOut; I feel so much relief. All I've wanted for so long was the damn diagnosis. No one could just give me the words. Now I have them, and a prescription for Lexapro.;
KeepYourClawsOut; I've dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my life. I've been on meds for both for over a year. For a long time I've been content if not happy. But the last few weeks I've been struggling. It's super frustrating because things are actually going pretty well for me right now. I have a job that truly appreciates me, a fantastic boyfriend, and I'm staying in my parents house while they are gone for the winter so I have my own place for the first time in a year. So why do I feel like bursting into tears at any given moment?;
KeepYourClawsOut; All they have ever done is sit. Listen. Write on their clipboard and tell me they will see me next week. Even when I have specifically asked for them to tell me what's wrong with me, they don't. It took me 4 different people just to be properly diagnosed with GAD and I cried I was so happy. This same person told me to buy a book about CBT and just told me to keep reading it and it would help. I stopped seeing him because he wasn't giving me any advice anymore.;
KeepYourClawsOut; At work I don't want to be around anyone. I don't want to have to talk or force a laugh or make myself smiley like they are used to. Today I hid away in my office for a majority of the day. Even brought my work in there so I could sit and listen to my music and break down when I needed to. I need to cry. I need to breakdown. I need to self harm but all of this is impossible because I live at home and my mother has no idea what privacy is.;
KeepYourClawsOut; I'm 24 and I've had depression since I was 6. Therapists. CBT. And medication. I'm so tired. I have been fighting to see a future for myself and I just don't see it.;
queer_artsy_kid; for the past few months I've been staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning, I'll feel exhausted keeping myself up so late but I feel like I don't deserve to sleep, and last night I kept myself up until 8am, so I wake up at like 2 or 3 in the afternoon on most days and it's messing me up. I keep myself up at night thinking about horrible things and lately I haven't had the motivation to even take my antidepressants twice a day, I've been taking them once every other day if I remember to take them. I've been considering going on a higher dosage since I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a few days. But I'm not sure how to break this sleep cycle.;
queer_artsy_kid; I've had a migraine for the past two days and my depressions been kind of bad lately, like I haven't showered in 4 days and ive mostly been lying in bed and sleeping a lot. But I've noticed that usually when my depression comes back so do my migraines, and I was wondering if this was common among other people with depression.;
queer_artsy_kid; I feel horrible, I can't feel my legs and I just feel really angry and anxious and like there's a bee hive in my chest. I already took my meds but it hasn't done anything;
queer_artsy_kid; Lately I've lost a lot of weight and haven't been eating, like I'll get hungry but I just don't feel like eating, so I'll just wait for the hunger pains to go away by themselves. I didn't really see a problem with this until people started pointing out that they never see me eating and that I'm starting to look unhealthily thin, even tho I can't really tell if I look thin or not. I've been weighing myself daily and my normal weight used to be 125 lbs. And I was around that weight pretty consistently for the past few years, but lately I've gone down to 110 lbs. And I personally haven't been able to see the difference if it wasn't for the people pointing it out. But I want to keep losing weight, because I want to see the number on the scale get lower. I've had anorexia in the past so my mom has been getting worried about me and asking me to eat more because I'm starting to look unhealthy again. I'm not sure what I should do, because I don't want to be anorexic again because the recovery processis hell, but at the same time I'm afraid of gaining weight.;
queer_artsy_kid; I always take notes when I feel like shit, and I've been feeling worse since I started going to an outpatient program. I don't really know what to do with all this, I guess if someone could help point me in the direction of what it is thats wrong with me, or if you've gone through something similar, your advice would be greatly appreciated.;
queer_artsy_kid; It's incredible that just this morning I was so overly happy and excited for no reason in particular and could hardly even contain myself, now I just feel numb, alone and hopeless, and I kind of just hate myself for being like this.;
queer_artsy_kid; I'm not a fan of self diagnosis, and I'm currently seeing a therapist and have been professionally diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, but I know that there's something else wrong with me. I have so many weird issues that can't be explained by depression and anxiety, like sometimes feeling like I'm not real or like I'm in a dream or something, and my fight or flight response it literally just freeze or accept what's about to happen and brace for it mentally. I've gone through trauma in the past that caused me to have intense flashbacks and I've undergone EMDR treatment. Sometimes I feel really paranoid and disconnected from reality. ;
queer_artsy_kid; I hate it so much, it's literally so fucking boring and I don't even like anyone there. I feel like it's just a massive waste of time, but at the same time I do want to get better and I'm not sure if things will improve over time. What I hate is that I can't see my therapist while going to this program, which sucks because I like one on one sessions way more than group therapy. I'm just conflicted on what to do because my therapist really wants me to do this program because she thinks it could really help me but I just can't get into it. Just being there makes me feel angry and irritable, and I don't know how to accept the program so I can actually gain something from it, because I have this weird superiority complex that makes me feel like I don't need this program and I don't know how to get over this, because deep down I just feel too scared and vulnerable to discuss my emotions infront of a group of people.;
queer_artsy_kid; I feel like I'm completely hallow and drained of any energy to do anything. I could hardly even get out of bed yesterday and honestly the only thing I want to do right now is sleep because I'm so fucking exhausted, even tho I have a math test tomorow that I need to study for.;
queer_artsy_kid; I feel like there's a gaping hole in my chest and I just feel completely empty and numb. My chest hurts because of how horrible I feel, it's like there's a weight on it. I've been feeling like this for weeks, and I feel like I'm rotting. I keep trying to reach out for help, but I feel like no one is actually helping me, because I still feel horrible. I'm just so hopeless and suicidal because no matter what I do, nothing helps, and I don't even understand why I'm like this.;
queer_artsy_kid; After having read about it I'm just so disappointed that it's not acknowledged in the DSM for being too similar to PTSD. Even though from what I read, Complex PTSD occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting PTSD from that. Because you developed while surrounded by trauma and C-PTSD is even acknowledged by the VA as a real disorder and I'm just confused as to if it's ever going to be acknowledged or not.;
queer_artsy_kid; I've been diagnosed with both Borderline Personality Disorder as well as PTSD. I saw a trauma specialist today for the second time and he said that I might not even have borderline at all and that it could just be really bad PTSD, so I'm a little confused on what my diagnosis is supposed to be.;
queer_artsy_kid; I don't really know what else to say, I already have depression anxiety and fucking PTSD and my nutritionist diagnosed me with anorexia and i just feel like a fucking mess right now, like at this point it just feels ridiculous that I have so many issues, and no I wasn't misdiagnosed, the only one im questioning is the anorexia diagnosis. I just feel weird, and confused.;
queer_artsy_kid; I really need to talk to someone;
queer_artsy_kid; I'm starting to recover from my eating disorder, like in the past few weeks I've gone from 103 to 110. Honestly I feel A LOT better now than I used to, because I'm no longer constantly fatigue and I don't feel like I'm going to pass out if I stand up too fast. I've even had my blood sugar drop so low in the past, it caused my parents call EMS because I became disoriented, and could't stand and I started blacking out and shaking. I just feel way better now and I don't constantly feel like shit anymore.;
queer_artsy_kid; Do you ever have nightmares that aren't even related to trauma, but they're so fucking horrifying that you can't even comprehend how your brain even came up with it?;
queer_artsy_kid; A lot of my fear of intimacy and relationships comes from my trauma warped perception that relationships are supposed to mirror my abuse as a child. For years I correlated being in a relationship with having no autonomy over myself, my thoughts, needs, and feelings don't matter, and that I am completely powerless. But yesterday I realized that I have these beliefs because my brain had equated the abuse I faced as a child, to what being in a relationship will be like. As a kid, I remember having this deep feeling of dread at the thought of ever being in a relationship because I thought any kind of romantic relationship in the future would just mean a continuation of what was happening to me at the time, and meant that I'd lose ownership over myself again and be completely powerless.;
queer_artsy_kid; I have really spotty memory but for some reason I can always re-experience how I felt during a certain time period or event, even if I cant remember anything else about it. It's like I only have memories in the form of the emotions I felt during it, and the emotional responses I have to the things I try to remember. A lot of the time I'm left having to piece everything back together around my emotional memory, just to get a sense of what actually happened.;
wildbynature_; I dream every night. I dream vividly every night. I remember almost all my dreams in the morning. I often struggle with differentiating my dreams and real life. for example I often have terrible dreams about my SO. My SO is amazing and I almost never have a reason to be uoset with him..But after these dreams I am so pissed of and irritated at him and I question everything he says or does..But he has done nothing wrong. My head is telling me he has betrayed me and I keep trying to tell myself that this was the dream but then I start to believe my lies and its all down hill from there. Any tips or similar stories?;
wildbynature_; Im taking 200mg. Can you guys share some stories about how it affects you?;
wildbynature_;" Ever since I have been a young girl I have had the most vivid dreams. I dream every single night. I remember and can recite my dreams every day and I still remember a lot of dreams I had as a young girl. I find it hard sometimes to remember the difference between reality and my dreams. I ask myself ""did that really happen or was that a dream"" often. Anyone else have this same occurrence? I feel blessed to have such vivid dreams but its sometimes over whelming as well. I have found medication that I react well to but I still have all the dreaming. Thoughts?";
wildbynature_; Much love. I know how hard it is to have to pretend to be okay if you are with family. Or those who are alone and suffering. Or both. You arent alone in the bigger picture we have to be strong and get thru to the next day.;
ashleycordova; I've been in therapy for almost a year now for anxiety only, not depression. But the depression has gotten so bad that I need medication. I am destroying relationships left and right and I cannot have that or I'll end up alone.;
ashleycordova; I was over in r/depression and someone posted about losing their identity. This really hit me because since I've been diagnosed with mental illnesses (anxiety and depression), my entire personality has disappeared. I used to be really funny, outgoing, sociable, friendly, fun to be around... you know just genuinely cool (early 20s). Now I'm just an irritated, unstable, difficult to be around, mental nightmare (late 20s).;
ashleycordova; I can't even get an appointment to be evaluated for anti-depressants for 2 weeks. Even then it will take more appointments to actually get prescribed something, and there's no guarantee the first thing I get prescribed will work. I can't talk to my therapist between sessions because of HIPA rules and she's so booked up I can barely see her once a month.;
ashleycordova; I've been in therapy treating anxiety for about a year now, but throughout my sessions, it's become clear I also have PDD. It makes total sense and it's 100% accurate for me. I live a pretty miserable life, but I do have a supportive boyfriend and best friend. They've helped me enough to where I don't want to jump off the freeway anymore, but I lack the motivation to make significant life changes to improve my quality of life (lose more weight, get a different job, etc.).;
ashleycordova; How intertwined are these two conditions? I am under the impression that low self esteem fuels depression, but I want to know the specifics of how they affect each other. My low self esteem makes up my entire personality and affects every waking thought and decision.;
ashleycordova; The Washington State quarterback was found dead yesterday from suicide. This really sucks, cuz I'm a huge sports fan and these guys are my heroes who keep me going when I feel like giving up. Say what you want about the Patriots, but Tom Brady did not give up when they were down 28-3 in the Super Bowl last year. He could've just thrown the game away, but he didn't. He dug his heels in and played every snap like his life was on the line.;
ashleycordova; My issue is that negative automatic thoughts take over and I can't get away from them. I get trapped in them and believe that they are the truth. It's like I'm possessed Exorcist-style. Examples: I don't deserve good things, I deserve to be criticized, I have no valuable skills, etc.;
ashleycordova; I was diagnosed with GAD a year ago but in the last month or so, I've been sleeping a lot lighter than I normally do. There's a cat in my house that meows loudly at night for water, BUT the thing is...I never used to hear him. Even if I did, I went back to sleep immediately.;
bittibabi; My boyfriend has depression and I want to be a good partner to him. He doesn't talk about it much, so I want to hear from you guys. What do you appreciate from a partner when it comes to handling your depression?;
bittibabi; I'm not sure where to post about this so I hope this is a good subreddit. Anyway, I love my daughter. She's so sweet and cute and as perfect as a person can be in my eyes. But I am so unfit to be her mother. I was 18 and still a senior in high school when I had her, and I did not want to be a mother at all. But I live in a small, Christian conservative town and getting an abortion while still dependent on my parents would not have been possible. They and all of my doctors talked me into keeping the baby, even though the father had been abusing me. As soon as I had our baby, he left.;
bittibabi; Especially when I'm texting my fp, bc you can't hear the tone of their voice or see their facial expressions/body language. I just constantly feel like I'm being annoying and too clingy.;
bittibabi; My sex drive is usually through the roof and I'm masochist. I'm not gonna get too into it, but I'm into some really freaky stuff. A lot of my past partners have even thought it was too much. My current boyfriend loves it, but he's surprised at how much sex I initiate compared to previous women.;
bittibabi; I wish I could shake this. I don't laugh or joke or have any life to my voice anymore. It always happens right after a huge emotional outburst and it drags on for days afterwards. Like that one outburst just sucked all the life out of me.;
bittibabi;" I've been told by several different sources that sometimes my eyes look ""dull"" or ""lifeless"". I was FaceTiming with my boyfriend and I couldn't help but notice it the whole time. They look dark and lack emotion even though my facial expressions do the opposite. Meanwhile his eyes (which are a darker color than mine) looked like they were shining and I could see how much he adores me just by looking at them. And now I'm worried he thinks I hate him or something, bc eyes are so telling. They're what we look at to know what someone is feeling.";
bittibabi;" My fp is studying and doing homework really intensely today, and he communicated with me that he needed to turn off his phone to focus better but that he'd talk to me later. But after that, I noticed he was active on fb for a bit. It's slightly bothering me, which is so stupid, I know. But whenever something ""slightly"" bothers me, it just progressively gets worse until I split and do something I regret. I don't want to bother him and seem crazy. I don't wanna stress him out. But a part of me is so convinced he just doesn't want to talk to me or he's getting sick of me or he's talking to someone else. My paranoia is probably one of my most intense BPD traits. I don't know how to get past it.";
bittibabi; It took all of my willpower to not grab my phone and start texting him. I missed him so much. It was actually my idea for us to not talk for a bit. I was splitting on him too much and I needed to do some damage control before I completely lost him for good. In the past, I would have just blown up his phone until he forgave me or pitied me enough to talk to me again. But I told him myself that we shouldn't talk for awhile, and it helped! After a few days, he reached out to me first and we talked things over and we're getting back on good terms. I am so proud of myself.;
bittibabi; But people usually aren't like that, right? I think it would be so reassuring if someone loved me that much. Especially my FP. I don't even know what my FP truly thinks of me since he's not as open about his feelings.;
bittibabi; I'm only 22 but I know I'm better than I was at 18. And that's saying a lot bc I still feel batshit insane most of the time.;
bittibabi; This disorder is so painfully misunderstood. Everyone thinks I'm dramatic but if anything, I'm holding in a LOT. It's like my body just won't let me control it and even breathing becomes hard. I get the jitters where I feel shaky and full of energy yet I can't seem to do anything remotely functional. I have brief moments where I dissociate and one second I'm on my bed hyperventilating and sobbing uncontrollably and next minute I'm in the shower doing the same thing. I get the urge to self harm (I haven't actually done it in a few months though). Other times I feel completely catatonic. My body just aches down to my bones and my head and heart both feel like they're pounding.;
bittibabi; I want to be the prettiest girl my boyfriend's ever had. I want to be the favorite sibling. I want to be the best at my job. I want to be the funniest friend. I guess it's bc criticism bothers me so much and I never feel good enough, deep down. It's so exhausting. And I know I can never be perfect, but I feel this pressure all the time that I have to be good in others' eyes and I need praise so I can feel good about myself.;
bittibabi; I need to sleep. I can't function enough to do anything else and I need to sleep it off. But I'm so upset that it's making my insides twist and turn and I want to scream, so it's hard for me to fall asleep.;
bittibabi; It's hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm feeling really bad, it feels like my body is slightly vibrating. It only happens if I've been at a bad low for a really long time and I've been really inactive, probably laying in bed bc my body is aching so bad. Anyone else experience this, or am I alone in this?;
bittibabi; Around 9 or 10 is when I remember myself getting extremely attached to other people. I was kinda stalker-ish. I remember I would have intense crushes, always on one person at a time, that would leave me in a mess of tears. Sometimes it was on teachers, other times it was peers my age. I would sometimes get physically sick over my own feelings, wouldn't be able to stop thinking about that person, etc. I even figured out where one boy lived when I was still in elementary school, and I would constantly ride my bike in front of his house hoping he'd notice me.;
bittibabi;" Just a reminder that we are not weak. We feel more intensely and if ""normal"" people felt things on the same level as us, they probably wouldn't be able to handle it. But we live it every day. We are so much tougher than we think.";
bittibabi; BPD is so weird bc I'll go through the most intense episode with a full mental breakdown and a plan of killing myself, then 30 minutes later I'm scrolling past memes and giggling;
Azr3all; So I'm sitting at the kitchen table, and my best friend is sitting across from me. And my mind starts spinning. I have a delusion that my friends, and family are going to be killed by someone and replaced with look a likes. So I start believing they took her too, so her defense (of course) was that she was the real her. But in my head I just knew the fake her would say something like that. So to prove that she was her she decided to play footise with me. It worked.;
Azr3all; I'm sweating, and I cant tell what's real, or not real right now. I've been dealing with this for about a year now. At this moment I'm shaking, and I can hear voices. It sounds like a crowded mall or something. A lot of voices drowning each other out rather than one specific voice right now.;
Azr3all; I have medication I take every day for my schizophrenia. Majority of the time it's a bit of a hassle to get to take them; I get the idea that they're poison. So my best friend likes to compare it to a video game, where she does the right combos to get me to calmly and easily take my medicine. And when I do she feels like she unlocks an achievement.
Azr3all; I was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. I have visual, auditory, and physical hallucinations. Sometimes I believe my teeth are melting out of my head, other times I believe people are going to kill and replace my family. I have tons of hallucinations. Some repeatedly show up: a huge black bird, a man that watches me, and shadow people. Some physical hallucinations include me tasting blood in my mouth, or feeling pain from an imaginary knife stabbing me. I am on medication, and self medicate with cannabis.;
Azr3all; I feel empty. I dont have an appetite. I dont want to get out of bed. I dont want to breathe. I dont have energy to do anything.;
Azr3all; I sleep all day because it's the closest I can get to death without dying.;
Azr3all; I tend to disassociate during my episodes, and it's the hardest to get over. How do you stop from disassociating, or help yourself get more grounded.;
Azr3all; I dont want to live anymore.;
Azr3all; I was just diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. There's not much information about it, and theres a lot of stigma arou d it. I've had people think I'm faking, or that I'm dangerous. I want to share my experience with people, and teach people who are curious about schizophrenia.;
Azr3all;" My husband treats me like a child because of my mental health. He thinks I should always listen to him. I feel like I cant do anything right. Even when I try to do things he tell me ""I told you so."" And that's hes ""always right"" if it ends badly. I dont know how to listen to my own body anymore. I dont feel like an adult at all. Everyone always wants to control me. It makes me so tired, and I dont even want to try to live. What for? I cant even live my own life.";
Azr3all; I want to be the girl that wakes up at 6 am, has a cup of tea, does yoga, and writes in her journal. I want to be a great mom that plays with her kids every day, and gives them all the attention they need. I want to be the wife that cooks dinner, and folds laundry in the same day I wash it. Why cant i. Why do I stop myself. Why cant I start. Why is the thought of bettering my life seem so exhausting. Why cant I be who I want to be. Why.;
Azr3all; I feel so alone. And worthless. I cant.;
FReakingAnonymous; When people yell at me or just give me a little bit of attitude, it makes me want to cry...it makes me wanna bang my head on the wall or something . I just start to feel bad.;
FReakingAnonymous; I’ve heard many people say that it’s selfish for someone to commit suicide. I thought that a long time ago too, not gonna lie.( and I feel extremely bad for thinking that.. Im sorry) But when I planned mine, I did it with out thinking clearly. I was blinded by the pain and sadness that I was feeling. At that time I was having a panic attack that wasn’t going away , i was shaking sweating , and crying uncontrollably for 5 hours straight. I knew what I was going to take, I knew when I was going to do it .. I knew everything. But I couldn’t control myself and I couldn’t control the suicidal thoughts that were going through my head at that moment.;
FReakingAnonymous; I’m completely done , I really can take this anymore. I’m just going to let my depression and anxiety consume me completely. I’m not going to kill myself , I’m just done trying..;
FReakingAnonymous; I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I’ve noticed that I’m having trouble with remembering things . Poor memory. Has anyone else gone through this ..?;
FReakingAnonymous; When people chew loudly, or when they keep dragging the spoon/fork on the plate. It makes me cringe really bad, it bothers me really really bad to the point in which I start to cry. And some people don’t take it seriously, and they make fun of me and keep making those noises because it’s “funny” It’s NOT funny, I CRY REALLY BAD. It makes me wanna bang my head on the wall!!! WHY DONT PEOPLE TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY?!? I’m crying really bad right now because someone just did this to me after I told them nicely if they could stop..;
1BoiledCabbage; For the past 8 years, I've told myself that the world was bad. That people were just mean spirited and that trust is earned through hard work and dedication. I also told myself that I had no friends and that people just didn't like me. I thought that by doing what I felt and not caring about what others thought, that it somehow made me free and independent, but I was so wrong.;
1BoiledCabbage; I was watching degrassi recently and a character was in the hospital for having (what they thought) Oppositional Defiant Disorder. I looked it up out of curiosity and it seemed way close to what I actually have. Well, the mood swing part. I feel like even after all these years, I can't control myself and when I'm having these episodes, I can get really scary. I get even worse when someone either laughs, tries to argue with me or insists that I'm a liar. It's like it sets me off into this free range beast that has lost all morals and would love nothing than to see and feel the world burn.;
1BoiledCabbage; Whenever I appear around her, she suddenly has to leave and does so within 3-5 minutes of me being there. It's been happening since our last long talk. That talk was over a month ago and I thought she'd be over what I said by now. In my opinion, it really wasn't that bad and any feelings I have towards her have been buried deep because she's now in a relationship. The relationship doesn't bother me at all but I feel like what I said to her did and I'm completely confused because she asked me to say it. However, I feel like a complete moron for doing so and I regret it more than I've regretted any other move I've made by mistaking deep friendship for love.;
1BoiledCabbage; It never stops and it's quite bothersome. My gut feeling tells me that people always have an issue with me but they say different. Meanwhile, it feels like they're trying to force themselves to be nice with me. On one hand, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and keep them as friends. On the other hand, I'm afraid that they're just messing with me for a laugh and therefore, I want to let them go. I have no idea what to do or how to get rid of this feeling inside of me.;
1BoiledCabbage; The biggest disappointment is, that no one really understands. They assume that I'm lazy, that I just want to sit around all day and do nothing but the truth is, I can't bring myself to. The moment I start to think about all of what's been going on, both in my world and in my head, things fall apart. I promised myself that I would stop doing bad things, that I wouldn't harm myself or go back to the hospital, that I would try to live a normal life. Hell, it may look normal from the outside, but there's nothing normal about me.;
1BoiledCabbage;" I have an addiction. An addiction that most people wouldn't consider an addiction but it is one regardless if they consider it to be or not. I'm addicted to escaping reality. It's the only thing that holds me together. The minute I slip out of an escape, I start having bad thoughts. Keeping myself in them has been the best thing for me mentally but physically and as far as my ""career"" goes, it's really not helping me at all.";
1BoiledCabbage; I try my hardest to act like everything is good, but it's not. I'm lonely and miserable. I get angry BECAUSE I'm lonely and miserable. If I died today, I know deep down that I'd be forgotten within 2 months. Not a word about me. I know why, but it still hurts to know how invaluable I am to everyone. I try so hard to fit in. To make new friends. There's just so much about me that's unlikable and I know that it's not the depression talking. I've seen it for myself, in people's eyes and in their body signals. I want to live. But unemployment, depression, sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living. I can't even see death as an escape. There is no escape for this. I'm going to be a shell no matter what.;
1BoiledCabbage; I want so much for myself but I just can't seem to get motivated towards anything. It's like I've completely given up without actually dying. I want love, I want to he happy and healthy, I want a good job and I want a good group of friends, but I know, deep in my heart, that it's not going to happen. I don't know why. I don't know how to fix myself and I don't know how to get better. I don't know where to go from here.;
1BoiledCabbage; I know what real love is like. Both from relationships and from family. I don't feel that anymore. I know I've got anger issues but there are so many things in this world, so many harsh comments and looks that I get from people that just make me so angry with everyone. I'm tired of being expected and pressured to fit into everyone else's mold without question. I'm tired of being expected to get up and carry everyone's baggage and take care of a family who has no clear interest in taking care of me too.;
1BoiledCabbage; I don't want to see the bad in the world again. I don't want to shroud myself in it. But by the way it looks, it's heading that way. I'm tired of the toxic behavior that's being constantly thrown at me, both online and off. I'm tired of being pressured to hold everyone together. I'm tired of being held to expectations that I'm having trouble to complete.;
1BoiledCabbage; You'll never get used to being unloved or unwanted. You'll never get used to the pain and suffering of being left out of fun events, group outings or friend/family moments. It always hurts and the heart break from each and every time it happens will only get worse as you start to realize just how unloved and unwanted you really are. This will turn to anger and the more you suppress it, the worse it gets. When you finally burst open and let all that anger out, they'll use it as the perfect excuse as to why they don't want you there.;
1BoiledCabbage; I've completely exhausted my options, I've completely exhausted my will to promote myself and with little to no success. I don't expect the people in my life to buy my art, but after hearing them go on about how much they like it, I figured they'd want to at least support me with social media follows. Hear me out. I'm not sad because I'm not getting likes, but sad because the people who seem like they're wanting to support me, aren't.;
1BoiledCabbage; Over the past couple of years, I've done a lot of reflecting on my personality and I'm actively trying to change my flaws for the better. It's not always easy, because at times, I feel like I'm losing a part of myself to appease others, but deep down, I know it's for the greater good. However, it's hard to know just what I need to fix and what I need to leave alone. People always seem to tolerate me to spare my feelings, but I can in their eyes, that they really don't want to talk to me.;
1BoiledCabbage; My family and I decided to postpone Thanksgiving this year, so that we could all eat together as a family. I told my parents that I would like to do it, so that they could kick back and relax. They agreed. Skip forward to today, and I wake up at 10 am to start cooking the food...only to find out that the food has already been cooked by my parents. I was immediately frustrated, I felt a bit betrayed. I know how to do this stuff, yet, they seemingly don't trust me with it. I held my tongue, started making the pumpkin pie. Yet, 5 minutes into it's baking time, the crust burns. I lost it. I know I shouldn't have and I know that it's literally a crust, but I couldn't stand it.;
1BoiledCabbage; I'm glad people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about their problems, but I seriously need a break. I'm also tired of my family acting like I can't be upset or annoyed with them. I'm not a therapist, a guidance counselor or a life coach, I can't help you like they can. It's good to tell someone how you feel, but I cannot handle everyone's emotional baggage when I'm still trying to fix myself.;
Motion_ambient; My ex left me. My friends left me. I’m being sexually assaulted by a neighbor every week. I have no one to talk to. I have the same worth as garbage or dog shit, apparently. Doubt anyone would be sad if I was gone.;
Motion_ambient; Walked into the store today to buy rope to hang myself with. I couldn’t find any so I just left. Feeling super upset.;
Motion_ambient; Anyone else feel physical pain or discomfort while depressed? Like in your chest and stomach area?;
Motion_ambient; My friends don’t care about my problems. Whenever I talk to my friends about things that are bothering me, I just get blown off. They either change the subject or completely ignore me. It makes me really upset.;
Motion_ambient; On four psychiatric drugs, in therapy, still don’t feel any better. Probably never will.;
Motion_ambient; I’m currently taking Lamictal (bipolar disorder), Buspar (GAD), and Lexapro (depression, GAD). I find they work pretty well, except I have mood swings from Hell. I’ll be ok one minute and I’ll want to kill myself the next. It’s pretty terrible.;
Motion_ambient; Can someone talk to me please? I just need someone to talk to. I’m feeling really down.;
Motion_ambient; Suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I just got a job. I finally have something to focus on for myself. I’m just really really nervous for my first day.;
Motion_ambient; Cat was laying on my computer chair in my room. I was in my bed crying and upset. She wakes up, meows a couple times, and jumped up on my bed and is currently laying on my legs.;
Motion_ambient; Went to the ER but chickened out at the last minute and told them I was there for stomach pains. I’m currently waiting for test results to come back. I know there’s nothing wrong with me physically. I’m just such a coward and was afraid of being admitted to inpatient psych again. I know my family will be disappointed in me.;
Motion_ambient; Like have you ever hurt the feelings of your friends and family due to your depression? I know I have, and I feel terrible for it. I’ve apologized but I can’t get rid of the guilt.;
Motion_ambient; Does anyone know when the proper time is to go to the hospital? I’ve been super depressed and suicidal lately. There are moments when it gets really intense and I feel I will follow through with it. It’s gotten to the point where I call the suicide hotline every day because I don’t know what else to do.;
Motion_ambient; Went to the ER. Told them I was actively suicidal. Instead of admitting me for treatment they let me go with access to pills, knives, and rope to hang myself with.;
Motion_ambient; When I’m super depressed, I take my Trazodone throughout the day so I can sleep through it. When I sleep, I don’t feel anything, and it’s great.;
Motion_ambient; Well I had eventually had enough, and told my parents. They confronted him (and his girlfriend) about it, but he lied and said he never did anything like that. I had messages on Facebook to prove it, but both him and his girlfriend said that I altered them using an app and was just looking for attention. My family remains friends with them and I’m no longer allowed near them for my own safety.;
Motion_ambient; Lately my depression has lifted a bit, but tonight I’m having a bad night. My suicidal thoughts have come back and I feel like I did months ago. I’m not sure if I’ll ever be healed again.;
Motion_ambient; First, she dropped me from once a week to once every other week without letting me know beforehand, so I had to deal with that. Now she’s cancelling my appointments, leaving me for 4 weeks without therapy, causing large gaps in my mental health treatment. I feel like I can’t get better this way. My depression is getting bad again and it’s frustrating to look forward to relief from a therapy appointment only for it to be cancelled.;
Motion_ambient; My ex emotionally abused me last year, which caused the development of PTSD and depression. I couldn’t stand living in my moms house anymore, so I moved in with my dad. His neighbor ended up sexually assaulting me, and when I told someone, I got called a liar and a “feminist trying to ruin someone’s life.” I lived there for a few months, and attempted suicide multiple times, requiring multiple hospitalizations. My dad’s ex and my sister make fun of my condition and call me an attention seeker so I moved back in with my mom, and all I can think about is ending my life. I’ve had to stop going to school and work because I couldn’t function as a human being and my life is going nowhere. I used to be happy before all this.;
Motion_ambient; My family is tired of me, my therapist is tired of me, my psychiatrist is tired of me. I’m sure even the suicide hotline is tired of me. It’s to the point I’m contacting either them or the Crisis Text Line on a daily basis because I have no one else to turn to. I’m also to the point where I think I need hospitalization because I’m getting more and more confident in my ability to successfully complete suicide. I just don’t know what to do anymore.;
Motion_ambient; I need to go back to the hospital. My next appointment with the psych isn’t until six weeks and my meds aren’t working. I can’t go on like this. I asked my boss if I could take a few days off to admit myself to the hospital to get my medication altered so I can feel better. Was told that I would be fired if I decided to admit myself. Yet he gets to go on staycation for no reason.;
Motion_ambient; I used to be really happy when I was a kid. I was even happy as a teenager. But now I feel like no matter what I do I just can’t be happy.;
Motion_ambient; When my ex and I broke up I lost 50 pounds due to not eating. Not eating was the only control that I felt I had. I became obsessed with losing more weight. I’ve gain a lot of it back now but a few days ago I tried vomiting what I ate. I just feel like what I put into my body is the only sense of control that I have left. Do you think this is the beginning of an eating disorder? If so what should I do? Thanks for any advice.;
Motion_ambient; After Kanye West visited the White House, people perpetuating the stigma against bipolar and other mental illnesses has really been bothering me, from CNN mocking him for being hospitalized to everyday people calling him crazy. I’ve been diagnosed as mentally ill since grade 7, but I’ve never realized how bad the stigma truly was. I did have an experience of falling out with a friend and them calling me crazy because of my bipolar diagnosis, but that was the only personal experience I have;
lostminddd;" My Mental HELL began 2 months ago. I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely. I don't know why. I don't know how. I don't know what to do next. I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing. I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.";
lostminddd;" So I am suffering from ??intrusive?? thoughts about suicide. Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy. As I was smoking I suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s...... I got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it, it felt real. Then I tried to calm my self but the thought ""Life is meaningless"" with somekind of weird ??future?? feeling came. The strike in the stomach became more intense, I immediately went to my room.";
lostminddd; So basically, it all started after reading about Chester Bennington's suicide, about 7 months ago, then I started having intrusive thoughts about it, then I googled it, started reading about depression, then I had a major panic attack, to the point of vomitting.(Yes, I know this is a typical trigger for OCD and this is how it usually starts, I had OCD episode 5 years ago, but can't remember exactly if it was the same.) Anyway, here is what happens.;
lostminddd; Can you force yourself to have anxiety, just because you don't want to admit that you like the thoughts? :( Also, can you have OCD thoughts without anxiety and does that mean that they are not OCD thoughts and are actually your thoughts? :(;
lostminddd; Fuuuuck. Last night I got hit. No idea if it is my Suicide-OCD or real suicidality. So I was sitting on my computer, it was in background kind of. And I suddenly realised My parents are asleep. Then I felt it building up. It is like 'life is meaningless' feeling, VERY REAL, feeling. I try to say that my new computer will come tomorrow or that it is irrational etc. But it doesn't help, it feels like I am really feeling this way and it is 199% me. Also urges. Like I noticed the power socket, and then I felt sn urge to go and do it which kept repeating, like the pointless feeling was pushing me. The worst thing is that it felt like me and less anxiety and like an 'exitement' kind of, and thoughts like 'just do it.' Etc. ;
Nayaritalv; My boyfriend and I have been together since 2016 but my parents didn’t approve and prohibited my relationship with him because they thought that my depression stemmed from him since he was depressed too, my parents believed that he was affecting me and it was all his doing. But of course, him and I kept in touch and saw each other pretty often but behind my parents’ back. I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism on 2017, I got treatment and my depression faded away. And now that my depression is back starting 2019 and already got checked out on my thyroid (everything’s completely fine) I don’t know why I’m feeling low again.;
Nayaritalv; This issue is about sexuality and I find it very uncomfortable to talk about it in person but I’ve been told that it’s best that I do talk about it but idk how to do so without having an anxiety attack. I’ve also been told “if you don’t feel awkward while talking to your therapist, it ain’t working”;
Nayaritalv; I was recently diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), it hasn’t been letting me live my life properly and I’d love to get some help but when my therapist suggested meds I got scared and I don’t think I’ll take them. Multiple family members have used meds and antidepressants before and some of them didn’t get any side effects but the ones who did get them struggled a lot. I’m not 100% sure about taking them and I know that if I do I have a high chance of feeling better but I’d be risking myself to other problems and side effects.;
Nayaritalv; I’ve been sitting on my couch playing video games and sleeping all day for about 12+ hours, I haven’t showered, have been eating excessively and have only gotten up a couple of times to go to the bathroom. I am disgusted with myself. The reason I’m doing this is because I want to distract myself eating, sleeping and playing games. I’ve been having intense urges to cut all week and I’m home alone today. I absolutely hate myself. I just wanted to get this out of my chest somewhere and somehow;
Nayaritalv; We went to the doctors for a checkup and she did some tests on me, later said that I lost 4 kilos in a year (which is apparently a lot?) and that I’m very close to malnutrition. I haven’t been having a healthy relationship with food lately because whenever I eat I feel physically sick (nauseous and with a stomachache) but ever since the doctor mentioned my weight loss, my mom thinks that I’m making it up. I overheard her talking to my dad about it and said something about how I look so skinny I’m a skeleton (which I don’t think I am). Now, I don’t really have any severe issues with my appearance;
Nayaritalv; I’ve been told by close friends and family that I tend to disassociate, but I’m not really sure if I do or not. I’ve never been told any of this by a psychologist or anyone certified to diagnose. Also, I don’t think that I’ve been in a traumatic event. I was in an very toxic romantic relationship not so long ago but it never got to physical abuse; it was really emotionally draining and hurtful, though.
ravenzero0; I just want to die. I'm not brave enough to be suicidal but if I suddenly got shot or was diagnosed with a terminal illness, I can't say I'd be mad at all right now. I'm depressed and at an all time low. My family has disowned me, my daughter doesn't acknowledge I exist, I have no friends, and I can't even find a job. Hope is hollow and love is a lie.;
ravenzero0;" I have reached a point where I've once again given up on life. I constantly feel like it's not worth it to continue playing this charade of incessant let downs and I am tired of fighting to build a life amid the slings and arrows of being a trans woman, just to see it all fall apart each and every time. I feel like I am completely and utterly alone in this world. My family and a large majority of my childhood friends have abandoned me, my daughter refuses to acknowledge my existence and has fully blocked any contact from me, and any ""friends"" I seem to make are either narcissists who are just out to take advantage of my depression or are friends until I'm the one that needs the help. I'm so tired of living this way. What's wrong with me that I can't even have a single friend that genuinely cares about me? I feel like dying -- I just want the hurting to stop.";
ravenzero0; I just wanted to say thank you for the support I received here a couple weeks ago when I was in an extremely dark place. Shorty after posting in here, I made the decision to hospitalize myself and just got out today. I am so grateful for the kind words I received and to anyone who reads this and are currently in that dark place, don't give up; you are worth so much more than the depression and anxiety are telling you right now. I promise it's worth the fight and if you feel like you need professional help I implore you to seek it. You are amazing, even if you can't see it right now.
ravenzero0;" My life is falling apart, again. In the mater of a few weeks I will be homeless and I have no idea what to do. This isn't the first time this has almost happened. In fact, it is becoming more of my MO than anything: ""Find a place, things are fine for a few months, something goes wrong, I end up moving out/almost homeless."" I am so tired of this. Because of this cycle of instability, I am starting to develop signs of BPD which I never had before...or maybe I did but was undiagnosed and my life is just exacerbating the disorder to ungodly levels. Either way, this is hell and I don't want to do this anymore.";
a-a-r-d-vark_; Absolutely nothing works. I have been depressed forever. I truly feel like it is impossible for me to live a happy and satisfying life. I started losing hope when I started college. I had so much optimism going in, I thought it would be the best 4 years of my life. So far it has not lived up to my expectations at all. I've been terribly lonely. I am not passionate about my major, or anything for that matter.;
a-a-r-d-vark_; I've been stuck with my problems for so long that communicating them is difficult. I have almost nobody I can candidly talk to about what I'm feeling. Except for this guy I met here on reddit almost 4 years ago, he knows all I've been going through. I vent to him sometimes but I really don't want to bother him too much so I've cut back a lot. I wouldn't count on him as a super reliable friend, he tends to leave my messages on read to end the conversation, and there's also a sexual aspect to our relationship. I don't quite count him as a friend, as most of our communication is through text, although we met in person 3 times 3 years ago. We don't talk frequently, so it often feels like I am alone.;
a-a-r-d-vark_; I've had doubts about my depression (actually, dysthymia) ever since I was diagnosed at 14-15. I'm 20, almost 21, and I've been on antidepressants for a while. I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm taking medicine for nothing. Before medicine I used to be very irritable and moody, it could have been depression but it also could have been my parents always making me upset. I find it really hard to explain how I'm feeling. I went to my psychiatrist yesterday and she asked me how long feelings of depression I have last. I couldn't really answer because I wasn't sure. I don't feel despair most of the time, I just feel...neutral. I feel like I just go through the motions everyday, no overwhelming feelings or depression or intense feelings of happiness. There's lingering sadness I guess, but it's not something I fixate on most of the day;
a-a-r-d-vark_; In my opinion, anxiety didn't majorly affect me before. When I was first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety nos, I had a few symptoms. For example, arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast. I was also diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, but I never really felt like I had it (I just think it's worth mentioning, I'm wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow). I started Zoloft at 14 and took it until last August, then I went through some medication changes. When I switched to Lexapro, I was okay for the first two months. Then something changed, I started not feeling like myself. One day I just started feeling off while studying for my exam, my vision went out of focus a little. This put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where things constantly felt off, disconnected and detached.;
vinboi15; Hello, everyone. I have had anxiety problems as far back as 7-8 years old. I am 17 now and a couple months ago in addition to Wellbutrin prescribed 1 month before this, for my depression, I was prescribed Remeron to help with anxiety. After a weeks or two, I started missing doses and had my first panic attack which was just awful. For the first few minutes it felt like a heart burn which I used to get so I didn't think about it, I started rubbing my chest to alleviate the feeling then out of no where the attack came and felt like someone grabbed my heart and squeezed it. This was then followed my the feeling of my heart pouring out blood. And then then tension in the heart/chest area and dizziness for the rest of the day.;
vinboi15; This is a big problem I’ve trying to understand this past year and it’s about how anxiety affects my brain chemistry. Today I was practice driving with my mom and suddenly dozed off into some kind of sleep/dream for a few seconds and nearly crashed the car into a sidewalk at probably 40mph. Luckily no ones hurt and the car isn’t damaged. I’m so pissed though because I know for sure I slept 8 hours last night and the night before. My sleep schedule app is averaging 7hrs 52 mins. These sleeps happen a lot when I’m driving, studying, watching TV, and reading, even video games;
vinboi15; It started with me working and noticing a sensation of warm water spilling on my right leg and this is on going. One night I got a heart palpitation driving home. And today, I’m feeling needles and pins all over my body striking a spot every few seconds. I hope this is a common anxiety problem because I’m worried this could be multiple scelerosis.;
vinboi15;" I took an IQ some months ago and results were that I have a slow processing speed and working memory. Prior to that I was diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt. In the hospital I was really relieved to learn that the problems I was so sick and tired of was due to depression and anxiety stealing resources from important parts of the brain. So, ever since, I've been hoping that my ""stupidness"" problems that are caused by depression will eventually go away but I've been on antidepressants and therapy for months. The main doctor there said I would feel the full effects of my antidepressent Welbutrin after a month, but it's been 7 months now and I'm honestly no different than before. I'm better than I have been out of the hospital and prior to the suicide attempt, but I'm exactly where I was 365 days ago. ";
vinboi15;" I'm trying to learn how to program and it involves a lot of reading/reasoning/and just doing things very fast. I've noticed that I have a lot of difficulty distinguishing true and false, which is the fundamentals of programming. When I come across something like ""not false"" my brain/thoughts just freeze. I notice this too when doing driving school lessons, the instructor would say turn right or left and I'd get confused sometimes doing the opposite or I would understand him but not quickly, like there's a 1 second delay between him saying turn left and me understanding that he said turn left and I need to turn left.";
vinboi15; I'm aware I have depression so some of these thoughts may not make any sense, but I just want to describe how I feel and I feel; angry, disappointed, ashamed, and you know if I told my therapist or doctors how I feel their immediate response would be 'oh it's just your depression' but then when their are reasons underlying why I feel this way it can't just simply be symptoms of 'chemical imbalances'. I wouldn't want to die if my brain was fucked and everything around me was fine but it seems my brain is fucked and everything is fucked.
vinboi15; I don’t remember when or why I set it to be that day but it showed up in my phones calendar as a reminder named ‘kill yourself’. Dec. 10th is my 18th Birthday. I feel like it was some kind of ultimatum probably for 2018 for me to make things better, but honestly after seeing that pop up on my phone, it’s made me feel really down, because nothing is better. I only feel better about things, mostly due to sheer ignorance and neglect, which in itself makes things worse.. My circumstances are the same as they’ve always been, my perspective has changed for the good or bad, but when looking at things objectively, it makes me want hurt myself as punishment. At least ignorance prevents me from suicide.;
vinboi15; I am a loser I've just realized a terrible truth. I know why I feel the way I do and it's because the reality is I'm a loser.;
kotourchan; I don't think I'm actually depressed, I haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I have some serious motivational issues. I don't hate myself, and I think I could do so many things if I could just get going. I have a pretty decent body, after not working out for a year and eating like shit (barely at all) I can still do 60 push-ups in a minute. I have so much potential to work and I let it slide. There are so many things I could work towards, things I need to change about myself and the world I live in. It's not that I think I couldn't do it, I just can't get off of my ass to try.;
kotourchan; I recently was diagnosed with a few things and major depressive disorder, I feel like maybe they are wrong though? I still feel pleasure for things, and always have. I can also be really cheery, overly so sometimes. Mostly I sit around watching videos, so I don't feel like I could be anhedonic because I still enjoy things :x. I get suicidal thoughts a lot, but I feel like that's because there's just not a point anymore. It's not like I'm sitting around staring at a wall though '_';
kotourchan; I want to die because I'll never be a normal human. (not a suicide letter) I'm never going to be normal, I'll never fit in with the people I want, look the way I want, act the way I want. I will not be capable of holding a job, and I will crash and burn. I can barely make a phone call, wtf is wrong with me. I've never been normal, that's because I'm just broken. It's not something that can be fixed, I've been trying that my whole life.;
kotourchan; I've been the hospital twice in the past 5 months, and I really don't want to go back but I guess I also don't want to die. I'm just really afraid of being labeled as someone who seeks attention. I tend to hide my thoughts because I have them so frequently. How do I tell if I'm serious or not - because I keep trying to kill myself but I don't tend to get very far;
kotourchan; I know that I'm going to kill myself. It's just a matter of time - so I know I need to get my girlfriend away from me so they're not there when I do it. Hopefully they never even hear about it. Then I need to write a note that will help any family I have to move on. I know I won't be able to prevent grief entirely but I can help mitigate it. Is there anything else that i haven't thought of? Or advice for any of the tasks I have? How do I even break a relationship off when we live together. Even if I can't die I need to do something because I can see how much I hurt my partner just by being so depressed all the time.;
asj1330;" I'm depressed and bipolar. Life is about to take a really big shit on me. I've been staying afloat on borrowed time. In my current state(officially diagnosed bipolar, but not medicated or in therapy), I really don't see how I can come out this anywhere near ""OK"" if you would. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was a freshman in high school. I have even acted on these thoughts twice. The first time just a rope broke, second time I was rescued and brought to a mental institution where I was diagnosed. There's a very keen reason for why I have these thoughts, or so I think at least.";
asj1330; Anyone else drown in self pity when they are going through a bout of depression? I'm in depression and I know that about myself is a really bad habit. I normally will drown in self pity when I'm depressed. I know it accomplishes nothing and probably makes things worse if anything. But I still do it and I don't know why, part of me thinks I do it for validation of how I feel.;
asj1330;" Hi everyone, I'm trying to get a plan together to take care of my mental illness. I live at home with my mom and dad so obviously they need to be part of it. However they are very not understanding about mental illness at all. I've tried to explain to them over and over that the cure for bipolar isn't just ""toughen up"". I've tried educating them on the disorder but they think mental illness research is ""a bunch of liberal propaganda"". I don't know how to deal with them, they're not supportive of me trying to find therapy or any help for this disorder. A lot of times I think it might be necessary to move out from them.";
asj1330; I think I drown myself in my own self pity because deep down I really just want someone to approach and validate how I feel about my life. I know this is really bad, but am I the only person that feels this way?;
asj1330; I have depression and I oftentimes have ideas and plans of how to get myself out of it. Problem is, when it comes time to doing it I never do. If I were to do even half of what I plan to do I would be doing much better life.;
asj1330; I'm finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death. I have very specific means of torture. Ripping off their noses with channel locks. Stomping on their face repeatedely, cutting all their tendons so they can't even fight back. I just imagine myself beating them to the point they're begging to be killed. Then I would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death. After that I would them stare in the eyes and kill them. The blood, the screams, the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness. I had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I’m going through a lot right now. I’m not handling any of it well. I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I routinely see my psychiatrist once a week. About a month ago, something kind of triggered my PTSD. I’m not quite sure what it is but I disassociate a lot and have severe panic attacks often now. I also have a severe chronic illness that greatly impacts my day to day life, have had illness half of my life and it will never go away. I’m in university. At some point during the semester, my anxiety and PTSD won. I stopped doing all schoolwork. I’ve been doing NOTHING for months. There were short weeks where I would make a rare appearance in my courses, my professors always perplexed as to why I show up and why I don’t.;
Myeyebrowsare_; You’re not going to die [myeyebrowsare_]. My brain is fucking with me. This anxiety/depression is your brain trying to fuck you up. You are okay. You’re not dying. You can get through this. Fight this. You’re not going to die. You will get through this. You have dealt with worse. You are okay. It will be okay soon enough. You took a Klonopin, it just takes a little longer to kick in. But once it does, you’ll feel better. It’s okay. You can go to bed in a few minutes. Tomorrow will be a better day. Dear god, please help me through the night I wrote this down to try and calm myself. I keep rereading it. I’m going to keep saying it until I am ok. I’m going to keep reading it until I fall asleep. I will be okay. Fuck my brain for trying to do this to me.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I also have a severe chronic illness (Ulcerative Colitis) that effects my quality of life every single day. Most importantly before anything else, I am not in danger of harming myself. This past week I’ve been having disassociating episodes. I’m not sure if that’s even the right terminology. I had one 4 days ago that was the worst I ever experienced, I didn’t even feel comfortable enough driving since I was so out of it. Once I snapped out of that funk, I thought I was going to be ok. But since then I’ve had more and more issues with dissociation, including right now. I am so overwhelmed with depression and anxiety that I feel like I can’t physically move from my desk which is where I’ve been almost all day. I’m so overwhelmed that I couldn’t even watch Netflix. It’s like I’m having a depressed panic attack. I can’t snap out of it.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I’m not sure if this is allowed here in this sub but I don’t know who else to tell. Most people wouldn’t see this as an accomplishment but I’m sure many of my fellow anxiety friends can appreciate how much it takes to even make that phone call. I’m 23, in University and I start my final year of classes on Monday if that means anything. I saw this psychiatrist for about 6 months a little over a year ago. I had some intense medical issues (on top of my mental issues), I missed one appointment and I never went back. The psychiatrist was phenomenal and genuinely cared about my well being. She would sit with me for two hours to just let me talk, and validate my feelings. When I missed my appointment she sent me follow up emails just asking if I’m doing okay. My anxiety won and I couldn’t even reply to her kind emails.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I have diagnosed PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I have been on Prozac, Seroquel, and Xanax for the last few months. I’ve been struggling more the last few weeks especially with dissociation and anxiety. Today, my psychiatrist switched me from 1.5mg of Xanax a day to 3mg of Klonopin (up to). They’re dissolvable tablets. She also switched my Seroquel from 25mg a day to 50mg a day. My Prozac remains the same at 15mg a day. I’m nervous about trying Klonopin because I don’t know anything about it really. I’ve only been on Xanax throughout the years. Is there any major difference? Doubling the dose of Seroquel doesn’t make me too nervous but something about the switch to Klonopin does. Any advice is appreciated!;
Myeyebrowsare_; I saw a new psychiatrist today to go over a new treatment plan for my PTSD. I was prescribed your typical antidepressants, Klonopin but was also prescribed Prazosin 1mg. From my understanding it was initially a blood pressure drug but is also used to help get rid of nightmares for PTSD patients and help me sleep.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I have been in a horrible pattern of insomnia for a few weeks now. I can’t get out of it. My psychiatrist had to take an emergency extended leave so I don’t have a doctor at the moment. My prescription of Klonopin 2mg/daily ran out and I’m pretty sure I just went through a withdrawal from it because I spent the last few days feeling dead.;
Myeyebrowsare_; I’ve been successfully going to bed at a normal time (without Ambien) and waking up at a normal time for the most part. I’m at the gym right now trying to get into a routine again. One day at a time. The nightmares are still horrific and I still disassociate more than I’d like. But I see my psychiatrist again on Thursday so we’ll see how it goes. Just wanted to post something positive for once!;
Myeyebrowsare_; I’ve started trying to write things down more. Not necessarily journal but just writing down little ideas I have in various notebooks. I’ve come to realize that when my PTSD is in full steam, my handwriting is different. I’m known in my family/friend group for having great penmanship. But now, the handwriting doesn’t even look close to before. I’ll write a thought out and then rip it out of my notebook since it just doesn’t look like I wrote it.;
Myeyebrowsare_; When I started to feel more “normal”, I was still highly anxious and I don’t know over what. But since the episode this morning, I’ve developed this weird tick that I can’t stop. I keep clenching my jaw, pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth and like sucking my cheeks in (almost like I’m imitating a fish). It’s been 12 hours since it’s started and I genuinely can’t get it to stop. It’s been so bad that my tongue is actually really starting to hurt. Has this happened to anyone else before??;
Myeyebrowsare_; I’m stuck, guys. I can’t get my eyes to close. I can’t lay in my bed with my eyes closed for more than 10 seconds without a deep overwhelming fear of doom overtaking me. I can’t fall asleep naturally. I take Xanax, ambien, and over the counter sleepaids to try and sleep. I’m tired of seeing the sunrise every morning. I’m tired of watching the days waste away before me because I’m so useless. I’m useless from the insomnia, the depression, anxiety and lack of motivation. My chronic illness has destroyed my life, the resulting PTSD has only made it worse.;
jerssie_82716; Anyone...? Please...If you read this text me...i need someone...anyone to talk to....;
jerssie_82716; Hey...from some text messages and a lot of thinking I could give this another try and I can trust reddit to be there when I need you guys just like I do for laughs...thank you for those that texted me and Helped even a little....thank you and I can promise that I will try my best to not think of it but for now thank you guys...;
jerssie_82716; Hey I know I post about stupid stuff but I’m actually going to kill myself.. I found out I was pregnant and the dad of the baby left me...as well as me going to depression and wanting to abort the baby but if I abort it then I’m killing a human being so I will be killing myself because I wouldn’t forgive myself if I killed a human...good bye world...;
jerssie_82716; I’ve been going through stuff a normal teen like me shouldn’t be going through. I live in a small house with one little sister and my parents. I also live with my nieces and nephews. I must admit I have a great life. Honestly I have clothes, food, a roof, a loving family, a boyfriend that loves me and amazing friends but of course I’m selfish so I can’t see that because it’s too little. I guess it’s like why is she saying goodbye nothing is wrong,, well there is...My sister is in jail and expects me to do everything and that means I go to court, I support her two kids so I’m basically a mom at the moment as well as sending her care packages and placing money on her books. The reason I do that is because my mom is dealing with too much. We have financial issues as well as too many kids to support. We barely get enough food and go shopping for clothes. ;
figurehead00; I posted this in the Antidepressants sub but didn't hear anything back. So, it's still early so maybe I just need to push through. I'd been on 40mg of Citalopram for about 3 years when I went to the doctor because my anxiety was getting worse. She had me switch to Effexor XR the very next day. I've been on 75mg since and so far my anxiety is unchanged or worse and my depression is coming back hard. I'm feeling terrible about myself, overwhelmed by everything, and losing interest is basically everything I like to do. Normally I love to play video games for hours but now none of them are doing anything for me.;
figurehead00; Hi guys, I could use some advice. I think I’m about to get fired. My depression has been pretty bad this last year, and it’s showing. I’ve been getting worse and worse at my job. I’m not smart enough to understand it, and as more and more work kept coming in I was getting so overwhelmed. My stupid brain just couldn’t keep up. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days. While I was out they found out how behind I was, how many mistakes I’ve made, and what a mess I’ve made of everything.;
figurehead00;" So I went to the doctor the other day for anxiety and depression. She switched me from Celexa to Effexor XR, as well as referring me to a psychiatrist/ counselor (not sure). I don't know if it's the switching meds or what, but my depression is getting way worse. My only experience with this kind of thing was in high school (33 now). I was a depressed kid and my dad insisted on a ""Christian counselor"". The first session I actually opened up, and then he invited my dad in and told him everything I'd said with me in the room. It was humiliating and really his only advice was to pray more. I'm not against religion at all but that probably wasn't the kind of help I needed.";
figurehead00; Hi all, so I’ve been depressed my whole life, and this last year has been really bad, so much so I even lost my job last week. Anyway, I emailed my doctor to ask about weening off the Effexor I’ve been on since I won’t be able to get it anymore, and she wants me to go to a psychiatrist for a “psychological evaluation”. She called in the referral today.;
figurehead00; Ugh. So back in January I got fired from my job because I was too stupid and made a mess of it (more on that in a minute). Since that was the second time that’s happened I decided to try and get help from the behavioral health place in town. Took a psychological evaluation and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. It also showed my “executive functioning” was “severely deficient” and that I’m likely asocial. I met with a psychiatrist who wants to start with ADHD meds and go from there. I’m actually kinda proud of myself for trying to get help, but it doesn’t change the fact that I’m a 34 year old unemployed loser with no college, no skills, no talents, and no hope.;
figurehead00; Just curious if anyone has felt this or can relate to this. Long story short I lost my job at the start of they year (poor performances, disorganized, etc), second in a row. Finally went to the behavioral health place in town and was diagnosed with Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. Great. Ever since I was fired I’ve felt completely paralyzed on where to go from here. I have no college, no skills, nothing. I’ve worked two kinds of jobs, factories and offices. I could never keep up with the office jobs (see above), and factories make me MISERABLE. It’s nothing against that kind of work, it’s me. Overtime, overnights, the danger, everything about it for some reason made me so sad I couldn’t stand it.;
figurehead00; I’ve always had depression, and it’s gotten really bad this year. It’s affecting every aspect of my life, I’ve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess I’d made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.;
figurehead00; I’ve posted a couple times on here the last week about how my depression has gotten a lot worse and it’s effected my job performance. I had a meeting this morning at 8am to discuss it. Well, they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures. I’d never talked to them about my depression, and how it’s ruining every part of my life, not just work. I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didn’t change anything. They don’t want me there. They sent me home to think about it, and they’re having an HR rep call me later to discuss my options.;
figurehead00; I’ve mentioned it a couple times on here lately, but my depression has been ruining most parts of my life, including job performance. I’ve got a meeting in the morning with my bosses about my poor performance and I think I’ll be fired. Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and I’m desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.;
figurehead00; My depression has gotten really bad the past year, so much so last week I lost my job. I couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t remember things, I’ve never been able to stay organized, made mistakes, got totally overwhelmed, got behind, got fired. Sigh. Also lost my insurance so I’m weening off the Effexor I’ve been on because I can’t get it anymore. Suffice to say things are not gong well. Now I’m in the awful position of having to look for a job with depression firing on all cylinders. Anything I would want to do (office work, having a computer, ac/heat, nice coworkers) I’m too stupid to do (as evidenced by my last two failed attempts). And the other option, stuff like factory work, makes me miserable. I’ve done it before, constant overtime, weird schedules, “macho” coworkers. I hate it so much.;
figurehead00; I’ve noticed that whenever I read anything about depression it’s always defined as episodes that last a certain amount of time and then ease for a while. And I don’t relate to that at all. I’m a 36M diagnosed with major depression, and I can’t remember ever having a period of time that stuck out as a depressive “episode.” I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t depressed. Certain aspects might wax and wane, like anhedonia for example, but at the core I don’t remember having positive emotions outside of little things in the moment (Super Nintendo for Christmas for example).;
figurehead00; So here’s the situation. I’m 35 and have been living with untreated Depression, Anxiety, and ADD. I was a terrible high school student, and have worked a series of factory jobs I hated and office jobs I was terrible at since. I’ve been fired from my last two office jobs, couldn’t keep up, couldn’t focus, couldn’t begin to get/stay organized, and just couldn’t understand my job no matter how much help I got.;
figurehead00; First off I’m definitely NOT asking for medical advice, not even looking to change anything, I’m just curious if I’m prescribed, like, a LOT of meds. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over a year, I like him. We’ve built up over time but it seems like every appointment another med gets added. To be clear, I’m not unhappy with the treatment. I just don’t know anyone with similar issues so I don’t have anything to compare it to. Here’s the breakdown;
figurehead00; So, I went to the the local mental health place early last year for depression, anxiety, and adhd (inattentive). I was tested and diagnosed with all three, started seeing a psychiatrist and have been taking medication for them since. I think it’s helped some, adhd a lot, depression a little, and anxiety not really. I’ve got a check in with the psychiatrist in the morning. Anyways, I’ve only ever focused on those three things, but there’s more that for some reason I’ve never addressed with him and I’m looking for advice on how to do it.;
Whittzy; I literally dread going back to school after every weekend. I hate it so fucking much. I stay home a lot and my grades are suffering quite badly. How can I make school not as bad? I am a high school sophomore btw;
Whittzy; Just started my new classes as a sophomore in high school. Been struggling with depression and anxiety quite bad this year. I have like a group of like 6ish close friends. I like them for the most part but this year especially I make up excuses a lot because I don't feel like doing anything. As much as I hate school it at least forced me to socialize with them and be less isolated. But with this new quarter I have none of them in any of my classes. I feel like this could be detrimental for my mental health and push me into an even worse depressed state and isolate me further. As much as I sometimes don't feel like socializing I know it is good for me. This is not going to be good...;
Whittzy; I suffer from depression as most of us here do and I really have no meaning in life right now. Normally I would have hockey so that would at least be something but I have been injured all season and honestly I don't really have any interest in the sport anyways atm. But basically my life has been school, video games, late night shows and sleep. I don't know how I can go on like this especially with how much I hate school. Also doesn't help that this semester I have none of my friends in any of my classes. How can I deal with this.;
Whittzy; I was just recently diagnosed with depression/anxiety on top of also recently being diagnosed with ADHD. I have been depressed for a while now but never said anything because I thought you had to be suicidal to be depressed. Some days I think about it a little bit but I'm not like super serious. How do I avoid getting into the suicidal state of mind because honestly it really scares me. For those who are wondering I just started taking Paxil for the anxiety/depression. Anything helps.;
Whittzy; I will be a junior in high school. I don't know if I can make it through 2 more years of high school. Not a single ounce of my body is ready for the school year.;
Whittzy; I've had the weirdest feelings lately. I don't want to do anything social but at the same time I want to do stuff. The few things I like to do I'll do and then after feel like I wasted my time and it was dumb. I'm just so conflicted I hate feeling this way.;
Whittzy; I live in small town South Dakota and I absolutely HATE it. I think this largely contributes to my depression. I already don't wanna go do anything but then when's it's below 0 half the year it makes it even harder. Also even if I feel like doing something there is hardly anything to do with friends other than movies. It is even harder to stay here especially after visiting LA this summer and absolutely loving it. I am in no position to move either being I am 16 living with my parents. Anyone else think where they live contributes to their depression.;
Whittzy; For starters I am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and I'm constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life. It has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping. I think if you are religious it can really help you with depression. But I just need to find meaning in life and I don't think I could handle doing a job that doesn't relate to comedy because that is how I find joy in life. Man that was all over the place...;
Whittzy; Anyone else feel this way? I personally am not always sad, I wouldn't say I am happy, but I'm just merely existing. I am sad at times but not always. I would more describe depression as feeling empty and meaningless and sadness is a symptom. Thoughts?;
Whittzy; Anyone else feel this way l? I constantly do and it's awful;
Whittzy; I have been playing football since 7th grade and I would say I have wanted to quit since the beginning of 9th. I already thought it wasn't worth all the time you put in but now with depression I have no desire what so ever. A big problem here is my coaches really like me and I dread having to deal with them and also more importantly my dad is an 8th grade FB coach and would HATE if I were to quit. I just really don't enjoy it at all anymore and it makes getting up for school even harder when we're in season. That's the other thing like we're not even in season I try to pride myself on not quitting in the middle of things so it shouldn't be as big of a deal to him. I don't know just thinking about it makes me more depressed... I am a sophomore right now and I don't think I can take 2 more years of football;
Whittzy; I'm not suicidal but I think about dying a lot. And I do think about killing myself (not seriously) over the smallest things. For example today I spilled something and I just thought to myself I could just end it so I don't have to deal with it. Or if I don't want to do something I'm the same way. Anyone else like this?;
Whittzy; Because of my depression I often don't want to do anything with any of my friends and often times when they text in the group chat if we wanna hang I don't respond. I don't want to do anything like I said, but at the same time I feel so shitty when I don't get invited or get left out. It's understandable why they don't invite me sometimes I get it. Anyone else like this?;
Whittzy; It is so hard to get up some days but I'm pretty sure my parents think I'm just making excuses to be home. I try to go if I can but some days I just can't. They don't understand...;
Whittzy; School is awful I can't even sleep thinking about going to school tomorrow school depresses me the most :(;
Whittzy; Depression convincing me I'm making it up Like I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and ADHD and I'm taking meds but a part of me is like your just lazy and faking it but idk why. It is super unsettling for me. Anyone else have this?;
Whittzy; I literally can hardly get myself to school in the mornings and end up staying home more often than I should. If I can actually get myself there I'm alright (although still depressed of course but I can usually make it through the day then). Anyone else like this we're just getting up is the hardest part?;
Whittzy; Hey guys. So I don't post here often, but I suffer from ADHD, depression and anxiety. So long story short, I was diagnosed around October although I should have been diagnosed a long while ago. So the first thing I went in for was ADHD. It took me this long to go in for this (I'm a sophomore in high school) mainly because although I couldn't pay attention I was smart enough to do well if that makes sense. And the main reason I actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers. But as I got older, starting around middle school, the material was getting harder so I had to pay attention to do as well as I normally did. And then I hit my lowest lows in high school, particularly this year. ;
Whittzy; I’ve really been feeling this lately. It’s like I’ve got school work to do, my job, appointments, hobbies, etc. And it just gets to the point where I can’t deal with any of it anymore and shutdown. It’s like a vicious cycle for me because when I shutdown and don’t do things I need to do it just keeps piling on and adding up and overwhelming me even more. Not sure if that was even comprehendible but can anyone relate?;
CareerCoachGuy; Looking for a PTSD buddy to chat with in private. Motivate and help each other heal. 30 m here. Inbox me.;
CareerCoachGuy; I've come to the conclusion that it's not the alcohol that effects my CNS and causes triggers, but the shame I feel after.;
CareerCoachGuy; Ptsd and valium withdrawal combo. Hurtin really bad. Anyone got some love for me? Anything;
CareerCoachGuy; How does alcohol affect your PTSD?;
CareerCoachGuy; Looking for PTSD buddy. I've been having a lot of triggers lately and could use the reassurance of a stranger. Pm me if you can help.;
CareerCoachGuy; Warning: This is in no way medical advice. I am not a doctor. This is for informational purposes only. I wanted to drop in here and write a post that I hope will help those who suffer from PTSD or developmental trauma. I will tell you what has and hasn't worked for me over the past 10 years of treatment. I'm going to break it down into sections: My symptoms and past, meds, therapeutic modalities, and social support. I will then supply you with titles to some topics and books which have helped.;
hurtymchurtface; As the title implies It’s slipping. I can feel it melting out my ears and eyes and all the parts of me. God how do people exist??????????? How do they just function without wanting to find a self-crusher and squish the crazy out of themselves. All I want to do is cry. I’m so much crazier than I thought I was. I’m so sick and I can’t get away from society long enough to make myself better. I’m sorry. I just need to get it out there. I wish I was gone.;
hurtymchurtface; I got married in July, and was very excited. In the post-calm and happiness of the wedding, I started to experience my first nightmares and flashbacks and my life was finally stable enough for my mind and body to cope with my trauma. So here is what is happening to the heart for a PTSD survivor!;
hurtymchurtface; My CPTSD stemmed from long standing and extremely harsh physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of my dad. I have had some nightmares related to the trauma, but as I get more into the therapy and whatnot, I have just been having nightmares out of control.;
hurtymchurtface; Post diagnosis and amid all the flashbacks and nightmares I am gaining so much weight. Not only has it been hard to get my workouts in, I want to eat everything. Anyone have any tips for managing this? I do not want to gain anymore weight;
hurtymchurtface; Here are my circumstances: -our family dog died just a couple days ago -I have one of my parents cats I agreed to watch during their move (my cat HATES this cat) -my sister was apparently violently raped a few days ago (I don’t know the details, I can’t handle them at this time, since it brought me back to a situation of my own) -my mom has started getting my sisters to call and leave me voicemails telling me it’s so messed up what I’m doing -my grandpa (mom side) has advanced lewey body dementia and is dying. I know my mom is super sad about this.;
hurtymchurtface; I put a refill in on Monday. It’s Thursday and I’m fucked. Up. Getting zero sleep. He won’t be back until Monday. Help!!!! How do you cope with the nightmares without meds??? I’m so scared the on call doctor won’t fill them;
hurtymchurtface; Honestly it’s so comforting to hear from other people and know that I’m not alone in this, and that all these quirky symptoms are normal when you are suffering from PTSD. My relationship with food, my anxiety in the car, my nightmares. Sometimes when I read something someone else wrote I’m like “hey!! I feel that EXACTLY!!!”;
hurtymchurtface; Insurance stopped covering my therapy, so I can no longer wax poetic about why I hate driving or how much I hate interacting with strangers. Nope. Can’t do that anymore as every session needs to be focused on the biggest part of my trauma. The real meat, which is the fact that I absolutely hate myself and hate myself for being abused. I am literally disgusted by myself. My female body parts. They make me want to gag. I feel like a child again being forced into sexuality again. I don’t know that I’ll EVER feel like a ‘woman’ and I get grossed out thinking about sex and body parts.;
hurtymchurtface; I am in the throes of horrible symptoms right now and it’s only getting more out of hand. How do I support my support? I know I’m exhausting. I know I’m so much work. He’s perfect and great and wonderful. I’m on duloxetine, clonazepam for panic attacks and prazosin for nightmares. I go to EMDR every Monday but my trigger persons texted me yesterday and I blocked them and disabled my insta but I am still so out of whack.;
hurtymchurtface; I don’t know how to be happy. I’ve had the most ridiculously incredible life the past year and a half or so, and all this happiness led to the PTSD coming out. I just can’t let myself be happy! I’m supposed to be miserable. It’s all I’m used to. How do I get past this? My life is amazing and great and beautiful and I don’t want to die anymore but I don’t know how to just be chill with it. Being so happy with my life is scaring the heck out of me;
hurtymchurtface; I’ve been an adult my whole life. I always had to be just to survive. I feel the little girl inside of me, but I’m angry she’s still here. My life is good now why can’t she just leave??? But I know she can’t. And I’m told I have to love her because she got me through it all but all I can feel is resentment that she continues to hold me back.;
hurtymchurtface; I had my Apple Watch on when a panic attack ensued. Heart rate was at 185bpm at 11:00 shortly after it began, and at 11:10 I took 1mg clonazepam and you can see my heart lower after that. I just thought it was kind of cool to see the effect of the medication on the heart.;
hurtymchurtface; I’ve been diagnosed with major depression since the age of 12, anxiety since 14, eating disordered at 16, narcolepsy at 18. Finally at 26 my Stanford trained doctor asked if I had ever been sexually abused and I didn’t want to admit it. Maybe it was my fault, but I’ve trusted this doctor for YEARS and so I went forward and boom, diagnosis is PTSD and I have basically all the symptoms.;
hurtymchurtface; I can’t be intimate. I am too scared, insecure, ashamed, guilty. I try to be, but then I just leave. I can’t feel it the way I am supposed to. I just feel so so so much shame. I don’t ever want to have sex. It’s just so scary. I love my spouse and it’s ruining what is otherwise a perfect marriage. I’m in EMDR therapy but god I want to be aroused so fucking bad. I was able to be so in the past when we first started dating, but ever since he’s been my provider I can’t stop being scared. I don’t know what to do.;
hurtymchurtface; I read that quote recently and I feel it very much today. I’m so mentally ill. So so so mentally ill. I miss my dad, my abuser. I miss my mom even more but I know I’d have to see him to see her. I’m hurting her by dealing with my abuse. The depression aspect of ptsd is completely wearing me down. I have to be up at 6:30 and interact with hundreds of strangers until I get home at 5:00pm exhausted. I have to be a good, horny, happy wife. ;
hurtymchurtface; I get them so bad I have to sit in my car and shake until they slow down so I can drive. It’s such a weird sensation and I just wonder if any one else gets those?;
hurtymchurtface; So tonight was maybe a breakthrough? My therapist says it sounds like I have PTSD as well as bipolar II. Does anyone else have this going on? The “bipolar” name really frightens me, but she says putting me on a mood stabilizer will really REALLY change my quality of life.;
hurtymchurtface; But goddamn if it doesn’t help me so so SO much. I literally hate going into that office, sitting down, using the tappers, visiting my trauma. I hate shaking after, I hate the nightmares induced. But wow. I am already so much more than who I was when I started 2 months ago. Things are just.... healing. I don’t know how to explain it. But I am so SO proud of myself for doing this. I can feel myself loving my spouse more, loving strangers more, loving myself more.;
hurtymchurtface; So I work at a Jr high school. We have one incredibly emotionally unstable student. He will come in to the counseling office (where I work as the nurse) and just WAIL. It’s not normal crying, and he can turn it off and on like a switch. So several days during the week he will come in and “turn on” this wail. The kid “turns off” the wail as soon as his mom complies with what he wants. He is extremely manipulative. The wailing though. It brings me right back to the abuse. The wailing sounds exactly like myself and my siblings when we were suffering the abuse. Yesterday, he was in the office just screaming and wailing, and we had to have 6 police officers come in and try to manage it before he was taken to a hospital. It caused a panic attack. ;
hurtymchurtface; I’m just so burnt out. Get home and lie in bed and look at my phone. I was a high level athlete, then, boom. I remembered it. And memories have been eeking out slowly. I loved my activities but I literally can’t get myself to do them. Will I ever be athletic again? I hate the way I feel physically, and especially mentally. How TF do people do their god damn job every day also??? I feel like I just want to end it all for the entirety of the work day.;
hurtymchurtface; I am apparently a pariah in my family now. My sister, who I have spent countless hours consoling over the phone and financing her divorce from her ‘abusive’ husband, broke my nose. My grandpa died. He’s the only grandpa I’ve ever known. My sister, who lives in a different state, needed to fly into my state for the funeral. I am closest of my family (for some reason THEY ALL FOLLOWED ME HERE) so I offered to house her and take her to the funeral.;
Tinabird20; My therapist suddenly left I have no idea why but had to change therapists. The problem is the new therapist doesn't seem to have read my notes. I know she can't know everything I talked about but she seemed to not know anything. I know my old therapist made notes so Im assuming she shouldve read them. She also doesn't seem to add a lot to the conversation. There a lot of awkward silences where my old therapist would key in on something bothering me and press me further. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I give it a week or just ask to change therapists now?.;
Tinabird20; Sometimes I feel like what happened to me isn't bad enough to have PTSD. But sometimes it feels like the straw that broke the camel's back. I think what happened caused PTSD because I was already not in a good mental health place. Please seek help if you're in that place. Its not to little to need help.;
Tinabird20; I have PTSD from being attacked by an intruder to my home. Now whenever I am upstairs and home alone I hear someone downstairs. Ive ran downstairs to look multiple times and no one is ever there. Is this part of the flashbacks from PTSD? Does anyone else experience this kind of half flashback half reality?;
Tinabird20; I was attacked by an intruder several months ago. I finally got up the nerve to see a therapist and was diagnosed with mild/moderate ptsd. My therapist warned me that the feelings could come up after talking about them again. Well they did. I know its part of therapy but its so hard.;
Tinabird20; I have PTSD associated with an intruder attacking me in my home. My therapist believes that I am having emotional regulatory issues now because a boundary was violated and now I have trouble setting up the proper boundaries. She wants me to do EMDR with another therapist at the practice. Anyone have experience with this treatment? I want to do anything to feel normal again but after reading up on it Im a little terrified of having to process the trauma.;
Tinabird20; Ive had anxiety forever. I was diagnosed when I was 10 years old. I had trauma recently that resulted in PTSD. One thing that my therapist said and I think everyone needs to hear is give yourselves credit for the days you win. A lot of us beat ourselves up over the days we have trouble being in public or getting out of bed. But we need to give ourselves credit for the days we get out of bed, the days we do the thing we have been avoiding, the days we win. Its hard to do these things when experiencing trauma.;
Tinabird20; Hi, I was attacked by an intruder to my home a few months ago. My therapist diagnosed me with Moderate PTSD. My landlord's matience man is very bad about knocking and announcing himself when he comes over. She notifies us a week ahead of time but with huge windows on when he can stop by. For example, he will be over Monday-Thursday 12-5. If we arent home he opens the rental with the key. The problem is he knocks on the back door once. Our back door has an entryway therefore, you cannot hear a knock anywhere in the house from that door. ;
SeekerofKnowledge93; We don't have to agree or get along at all. I have my view points and my term of reference I like to use and you guys have yours. I've had my fill of certain users constantly getting at me in the comments. If you don't like me or agree with my goals. Fine whatever. Whether I'm winning or losing in life in life. I can do it with or without you. As a sufferer of PTSD the one thing I had to learn was whether or not to engage. Some people love to be miserable and dictate to others. Some people do not. But enough is enough. I'm done and I'm moving on from any discussion over my ambitions.;
SeekerofKnowledge93; What are your thoughts on medical marijuana? Is it a good or a bad thing for suffers of PTSD?;
SeekerofKnowledge93; I was diagnosed with PTSD, STPD, and MDD when I was twenty two. I would like to go to community college by next year. What would be the best course for me?;
SeekerofKnowledge93; CBD oil, Medical Marijuana, or traditional psychiatrist prescribed medicine. Which method of medication work best for you?;
SeekerofKnowledge93; It's been a while since I've posted on my mental health. Things on the surface have been going incredibly well. I'm losing weight, driving lessons are going well, and the I could been working in due time. Yet with all due respect I feel like a fucking wreck. I feel like I'm not good enough. Sure I dropped a considerable amount of weight, but I still feel like crap. I don't feel so great at all. I feel small I fell mediocre. I wanted to go to community college, but I couldn't find a major. I couldn't find anything that made me feel worth studying for. I feel like shit because I had plans to someday rent properties south of the border, but the town I wanted had too much violence stemming from meth addicts. My fucking parents are bothering me about my idiot brother. Sure he's improving, but he's so slow at getting things done. Yet my parents want me to do their job and help raise their son.;
marrubizko; For about as long as I can remember, I've considered myself a staunch advocate for mental health care and the rights of people suffering from mental illness. These sorts of issues have always been part of my life in some way. I had an uncle who committed suicide before I was born. My father was in the military, and while he got out when I was still pretty young, he was left with a traumatic brain injury, chronic back pain, severe depression, and PTSD. When I was in middle school, he developed a dependency on alcohol that remains with him to this day. My mother had a tumultuous childhood that was marked by poverty and abuse. Her father and step-mother were both violent alcoholics. Her mother died when she was 19 years old.;
marrubizko; I posted on here recently about how I was choked by a student at work (I work with students with autism) and thought I might have developed PTSD... Well, Monday I was officially diagnosed. Tuesday night the anxiety got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. It has become this incredibly overwhelming situation because of all the insurance stuff and the many different health care providers involved, some of whom are worker's comp and some of whom aren't. People are suggesting I get an attorney. I have no family nearby. I'm almost out of money and I don't know how much I'll get paid this month because I've missed so much work, so I don't even know that I'm going to be able to afford to get to all of my doctor and therapy appointments (I don't drive due to a medical condition, so I pretty much have to take lyft/uber to all my appointments), let alone pay rent or buy food.;
marrubizko; I've struggled with anxiety and depression a lot in the past but have mostly managed to keep them under control for the past couple years, thanks to medication and therapy. A few weeks ago I had a pretty traumatic experience. I work with students with disabilities in and was recently in an incident in which a student overpowered me and before I even knew what was happening, I was in a situation that could have killed me. Thankfully everything turned out okay, but it was pretty scary, and there were definitely some moments when I wasn't sure if it was going to be okay.;
marrubizko; I posted on here about 6 months ago when I was first diagnosed with PTSD following a series of assaults by a special education student I work(ed) with. I've been working with a psychologist, psychiatrist, and work comp doctor, and in certain areas things have improved, while in others I still struggle a lot, especially when under stress or when exposed to triggering stimuli.;
marrubizko; I posted on here a little while ago when I experienced a traumatic event in which I was pinned down and choked by a student in the special education classroom I work in, and I suspected I had developed PTSD. I posted again after I was officially diagnosed with PTSD last Monday. The anxiety is still pretty overwhelming. I still can't work. They had to up my Ativan dosage and refer me to a psychiatrist because of concerns that I may be developing panic disorder. Everything is a mess because between worker's comp and my regular healthcare people, there are so many people involved who have to be kept updated and have to communicate amongst each other in order for things to run smoothly.;
marrubizko; Ever since developing PTSD, I've found that the list of movies and TV shows I can't watch just gets longer and longer. I've never been into horror or anything anyways, but I did used to watch some fairly intense and suspenseful shows, and I can't do that anymore, at least right now.;
FinnsChips; My PTSD is caused by many traumas I dealt with in school, because of this going to school is nearly impossible, I get shakes, sweaty, I get horrible memories swirling around in my head over and over, I become paranoid, delusional, feel unsafe and like someone is going to hurt me, I hear voices that aren't there, I just cannot deal with it. Last year when I was attending school regularly, I would cut and burn myself every single day, many times, I tried to hang myself, I had breakdowns constantly, I ended up in a psych ward where I was told my depression had gotten so bad I was psychotic, all because of school. The very idea of having to go horrifies me, I haven't been in about 8 or 9 weeks, and I haven't tried to kill myself and I'm only cutting a couple of times a week, but I know my lack of attendance will come back to haunt me at some point.;
FinnsChips; I was diagnosed with PTSD a week ago, and I hate that what happened to me is milder than what other people go through, I dealt with some long term sexual abuse, physical abuse, abandonment, neglect, death and illness but none of it feels major enough. I feel like I'm using it as an excuse to be a worthless waste of space who deserves death.;
FinnsChips; I've been having extreme urges to break into my old school where I experienced a lot of pretty horrible things, and I'm not looking for people to tell me not to do it, what I choose to do is my choice, but has anyone else ever had those sorts of urges, whether they relate to a person, or a place, or an object?;
FinnsChips; When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in. I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing.;
FinnsChips; So, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a severe generalized anxiety disorder, but I've been having some symptoms over the last year and a half that don't seem to fit into those categories. I've been experiencing a very extreme fluctuating mood, I can go from feeling extremely elated and invincible, having so many thoughts and ideas running through my head, talking very fast, having extreme amounts of energy, and feeling oddly irritated with people, to feeling horribly depressed and empty. I'm extremely impulsive, which has lead to me basically covering my body in self harm cuts and scars in less than a year, along with just randomly tying a noose up and hanging myself, not even necessarily because I really want to be dead, but just to see if I will die this time.;
FinnsChips; I feel afraid to talk to them because I worry I'm just boring them and I keep looking for signs that they all hate me, to a point where I make the most bizarre things into conclusive proof that I'm better off alone instead of bothering others with my existence. I worry that whenever they're alone they just talk about how fucked up I am and it terrifies me because for all I know they're going to randomly reveal that they've just been faking our friendship all along and I won't have anyone and I will genuinely be completely out of reasons to live. ;
FinnsChips; I often feel like all the parts of my life are very confusing, I often get a distorted sense of time, I will think it's 2pm at midnight, for example, and I often find my sense of reality to be very odd, I struggle to know whether or not anything is real, and if it is everything seems to blend together into one big slab of time where I'm not there, like I'm watching it happen from somewhere else, watching time speed by before my eyes. I also tend to have very confused thoughts, I'll be speaking then suddenly forget what I was saying, or even the topic of conversation or who I'm talking to, or I'll just randomly say stuff that makes no sense and I don't know why.;
FinnsChips;" So a very basic rundown of my mental illness history: I'm a 15 year old male who has had anxiety issues my whole life, but morphed into severe social anxiety disorder 4 years ago. I have had major depressive disorder for 4 years, and I was recently told by my psychologist that I appear to be a ""self-aware borderline"". I have struggled with pretty severe self harm for about a year now, and I have covered myself in scars. I've made a couple of suicide attempts due to all of this, and I've noticed that recently (maybe over the past 9 months) I've been extremely short tempered and will get very angry at people for the slightest things, especially my parents. I've told them that I can't control the anger multiple times, but they keep just believing that I'm using that as an excuse to be an asshole. Truth is, I really cannot control myself when I'm in this angry state";
FinnsChips; I don't care about sleep, it's 4:33 am right now, I'm exhausted and starving but I couldn't care less. I've stopped going to school, and when I do go I sit in the class silently doing nothing. I'm 16, I have no partner, no part time job, my friends all go to a different schools and make excuses to avoid seeing me, I have thousands of self harm scars, I think about death almost constantly, I dunno where my life goes from here. I'm a lost cause, I've been sick for years and I've only gotten worse and worse, therapy, medication, inpatient treatment, mindfulness, all this other made up bullshit does nothing. I'm such a fuckup it's insane, I don't know how I ended up like this but I'm such a disappointing little shit of a son that I pity my parents for having to know that they gave birth to me and now they have to deal with all my bullshit.;
FinnsChips; I'm currently sitting in a bathroom stall at my high school that I've only been at for a few weeks, thigh bleeding from the three cuts I made about 10 minutes ago. I don't even know what class I'm meant to be in right now, I'm just so fed up with everything, I just don't have the energy to try and put the effort in anymore. I just feel so fucking empty, and I feel like there's no point to any of this. Why should I show up to class if it doesn't even matter in the lifetime of the universe? So I might get detention, or suspended, or expelled. Who cares. I'm only year eleven and my life has fallen apart and I can't seem to put it back together again.;
FinnsChips;" I thought I'd hit my limit a few months ago when I tried to kill myself, but compared to now those times seemed like heaven. I just can't live anymore. You can always say ""it'll get better, don't give up, you're stronger than this,"" that's all bullshit. I'm not strong, if I was strong I wouldn't have covered my whole body in self harm in the space of less than a year, I wouldn't have tried to kill myself, I wouldn't be such a failure, I have a psychologist, a psychiatrist, I'm on meds, my mum's supportive, I still feel the way I do. I'm weak, I'm so weak and useless. I had a horrible cutting incident last night, I carved ""failure"" into my thigh then cut like mad from my thigh all the way up my hip. I cut at least 200 times and I'm planning something similar tonight. I'm so scared. I know what I can do to myself and I'm scared because I know I'll do it. I don't deserve to feel this way.";
FinnsChips; I took today off school. My depression is just too much to deal with, yesterday I cut about 5 times at different times of day at school. Last year my parents forced me to take 6 weeks off school after I made a suicide attempt, and this actually helped me pull my act together, and halfway through being off school I went clean from self harm for a month and a half. Of course, I eventually relapsed and get caught back up in my addiction, daily cutting and burning. I was supposed to go to a mental hospital last week, but they all have a waiting list of at least 3 weeks so I have to wait until 20th of March until I can get into one.;
FinnsChips; I haven't been through enough to be as fucked up as I am. I can't function, I've gotta change schools because I'm just not going to school ever currently, I have no motivation to do anything, I just lie in bed all day wasting away, and I'm only 16. I've covered my body in self harm cuts, burns and scars, I've attempted suicide, I feel so emotionally unstable all the time, one minute I'm extremely depressed then I'll get extremely angry at the smallest of things then I'll go manic without warning and that'll keep happening over and over again, I'm just a huge disappointment. My parents are still together, happy, my mum tries to support me as much as she can, my dad doesn't really understand how I work so he doesn't help me much, but I live in a house, I have food, we might not have all the money we could ever want but we have enough to get by. ;
FinnsChips; I've had major depressive disorder for many years now, and it got to the point sometime last year where I didn't have the energy or the ability to practice personal hygiene, such as showering daily or brushing my teeth. I got braces on a few months ago, and I am hopeless at caring for them. I never used to brush my teeth before I got them on due to my depression, and it's just dawned upon me that I haven't brushed my teeth in a very long time, like, at least a week, probably two. I'm already aware my teeth will probably be kind of fucked, but is there any chance I might not have those white spots on my teeth when I get my braces off?;
FinnsChips; So I'm a male, I'm 16, and I was thinking today (bad idea, I know), I was thinking about the previous school I was at, and I remembered something quite traumatic that happened to me in year 9, when I was 14. I'm not sure how I didn't remember this until now, but it's possible that my brain forced me to forget it. Okay, so, in year 9 I had really terrible anxiety and that made me an easy bullying target, and I was bullied very badly, but one kid in particular went a bit overboard. I sat next to this kid, I'll call him Angus. I sat next to Angus in history due to our seating arrangement, and every lesson he would make sexual actions towards me. It started off mild, like he'd just say quietly that he wanted to kiss me or sleep with me, creepy shit like that, but then it got worse. He began to touch me. Quite inappropriately.;
FinnsChips; I've been through a lot of bullying since kindergarten until last year. I'm in year 11 now. When I was young I wasn't dealing with the bullying, I thought it was normal because it was something that had always been happening but when it got really bad in year 6 I told my parents eventually because I realised I couldn't go on with it. Year 7 it began again, and then stopped, then it returned yet again in year 9, but when I got to year 10 I began realising how to deal with it. I have developed many extremely severe mental illnesses from lots of trauma I've experienced and this leads to lots of self hatred and lack of self worth, and I used this to my advantage. When I was called faggot, fuckup, fatass gorilla, anorexic, cutter, emo, any of it, I would laugh and fully agree, and even start giving them ideas for insults to give me. This threw them back a lot, but the physical side of it was still an issue.;
FinnsChips; I am constantly going all over the place emotionally, one second I'm okay then I'm suddenly extremely depressed and then I'm manic then I'm overridden by extreme anger or  I just feel fucking nothing like there's a hole inside me and I just sit there slicing into my own skin all the fucking time because I have no energy to do anything else, and I always lie to people I care about because I want them to care too but I also hate them but I don't and I get so confused and I hate how attached I am to people because it probably scares them even though they might not even know but I think they do and that scares me because then they'll leave and I hate it and I have that I'm such a lying cutting depressed unstable piece of shit who spends every second of his life having a fucking existential crisis and being afraid of death but also craving it and not knowing what's happening in my head and not taking my meds because I get anxiety around taking them because they could kill me but also maybe not and then of course every time I go for a walk to calm myself ;
FinnsChips; I got braces a year and a half ago, I took good care of them for a while but, as my mental illnesses worsened my self care fucked off and I stopped brushing my teeth. Today one of my brackets fell off, which isn't a huge issue, but underneath my tooth has been decayed, and the same will apply to all the others when I get my braces off. It'll cost thousands to fix this, I don't know how I've let myself fall this far;
FinnsChips; My mental health is all over the place, I don't know what illness I've even got anymore. I know I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (both diagnosed by a psychiatrist), but I was referred to a psych ward a month ago with a diagnosis of bipolar 2 with psychotic symptoms by the same psychiatrist, then when I was there they diagnosed me with psychosis and said they don't think I'm bipolar, but they also mentioned something about a subtype of schizophrenia. I'm a 16 year old male if that helps at all. Basically, I've had anxiety issues ever since I was 5, I also had a lot of experience with having auditory hallucinations at the same very young age, they went away eventually but my anxiety stayed and began getting worse.;
FinnsChips; The ward is a couple of hours away, so it'll be a long drive. I'm kind of excited in a weird way, I might finally be in the hands of people who can help me. I was recently diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, which was a bit surprising, I always thought I just had depression/anxiety, but I guess this explains those periods of time where I am extremely energetic to the point where I begin being extremely impulsive and basically idiotic. My cutting will finally be put under control, no more covering myself in scars to purposely ruin my body. At least, no more of that for a few weeks. It'll be an interesting experience. It'll fuck with my schooling a fair bit but my mental illnesses already fucked over my education enough anyway, and this might be a start to my recovery. ;
FinnsChips; I've ruined my life with my mental illnesses and self harm and the only thing I ever care about is that I've ruined my teeth because I haven't brushed them in months due to having no motivation and I have braces.;
FinnsChips; I'll look at a video on YouTube that I seem to remember coming out recently, only to find it's eight months old. I'll keep saying it's June when it's mid September. A few days ago I was listening to music and I could hear it going faster than usual, despite knowing the song well. I'm so confused, it's like this physical feeling of time moving faster than I am. What's going on?;
FinnsChips; I know lots of people say that they have no motivation, but those people still do things, they still function to some degree, I just don't. I barely leave the house, don't bother with school, don't bother with any sort of study, I just spend my life in bed or in front of a computer screen and I don't ever see that changing until I finally manage to kill myself. I've tried many, many things over the years to try and help me, nothing does shit, exercise doesn't help, medication doesn't help no matter which one I try, sleep doesn't help, eating right is something I've always done, it doesn't help, meditation or any mindfulness shit makes me worse, therapy is just a place for me to realise I'm selfish and extremely weak, nothing helps, I just see no reason in trying anymore, for years I hoped it would improve,;
FinnsChips; I hadn't seen him in about 6 months, and today in our appointment he told me that I'm just wasting resources, he doesn't know what to do with me and nobody else does either, that they're doing everything I can but I'm still just sitting around at home all day being a burden on everyone, at this point he just thinks that I can't be cured but he still expects me to just get better, he actually told me that one of the programs I used to attend kicked me out because I was so wasteful to them, and that every time I seem to get better it doesn't last and I just collapse even harder, he doesn't know how to help me and nobody else does either. Maybe now killing myself actually makes sense.;
FinnsChips; Basically, I'm a 16 year old male, I've dealt with anxiety my whole life, I developed depression when I was 12 due to multiple traumas, bullying, deaths, my mum becoming terminally ill, etc, and my depression worsened over the years, I began getting bullied verbally and physically again, my friends began emotionally and physically abusing me on a daily basis and I dealt with prolonged sexual assault by a classmate, I began self harming when I was 14, I attempted suicide last year, I was in a psych ward in March this year where I was diagnosed with psychosis, and earlier this week my doctor said that, because medication has no effect on me, therapy doesn't do anything, neither do any sort of techniques often used to treat depression, and since my depression is extremely severe at this point, he said the only option left is ECT.;
FinnsChips; Everything I used to enjoy has become worthless, it all feels like a chore rather than a relaxing hobby, nothing holds meaning, nothing feels exciting, everything feels dull and pointless, I've tried everything to improve this, but it doesn't work. Do I just have to keep barely existing until I kill myself or wind up homeless? There really isn't any other way I see my life going.;
FinnsChips; My depression has always involved a lot of self blame, guilt, and self hatred, as well as anger and emptiness. I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me. I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole. ;
FinnsChips; I have this constant urge to break something, throw a glass through the window, smash my fist through the wall, grab a bat and start destroying everything I can see, or anything else, I just want to destroy things. I tend to take my emotions out on myself because I'm afraid I would hurt others if I didn't, but right now I just need to break something, smash something, anything.;
FinnsChips;" Depression was barely even on my radar, I knew it existed but I didn't think it was common or that I would ever deal with it. I don't even know what I thought depression was, I might have just thought ""oh, you're just sad a lot."" Now I know how wrong I was.";
FinnsChips; My psychotic depression pushes me to the verge of suicide constantly but my severe anxiety gives me an irrational fear of the unknown, including death. I'm pretty trapped.;
FinnsChips; I'm scared to be awake, I'm scared to go to sleep, and I can't kill myself because I'm scared of what comes next. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.;
FinnsChips;" I fucking despise when people say this, or when they rattle off ""good sleep, good exercise and a balanced diet is all you need"" because it is total bullshit. I went out for a few days recently, just me and a couple mates, I felt like absolute shit the entire time, despite getting a good 9 hours of sleep, eating well and getting out a lot. In fact, when I got home I cut myself that night and actually came quite close to an overdose the next morning. Despite this, I just know people will still babble on that I'm just not trying hard enough, and that exercise will be my saviour, despite me being severely depressed while doing soccer and tennis weekly and also working as a referee a couple years ago.";
FinnsChips;" All these stories saying ""I was extremely depressed as a teen, but i got better and eventually graduated with a degree in every subject known to man!"" just feel so unrealistic, I mean, they could happen sometimes, but where are all the stories saying ""I was extremely depressed as a teen, I dropped out of school at 15, and now 10 years later I'm still living with my parents without any sort of proper education beyond year 10, covered in self inflicted scars, dealing with organ failure due to my drug abuse, and and struggling to eat from years of bulimia, but hey, I'm still alive!"" That just sounds so much more realistic, and it could help those people who are in that position where they can't go to school anymore, they're struggling to get out of bed and they don't know what to do.";
FinnsChips; I don't try to feel nothing towards others, I just can't. I don't want to hurt people but I just don't care about them. I never have. Not my family, not my friends, absolutely nobody except my best friend, and I'm still not sure how I care about him. This never used to bother me until I recently realised just how lonely this is. Having nobody to care about, nobody to genuinely laugh with and enjoy their company. I'm going to have to be stuck in my own schizophrenic mind alone for the test of this pathetic existence and that has really started to fuck me up.;
FinnsChips; My illness tends to present itself in a more delusional manner, with hallucinations being more scattered and nonsensical, but they're quite infrequent. However, I occasionally suffer from periods where they spike hugely, but they're all disconnected from each other. I just saw a dog run past when I was getting a bottle of water from the fridge, then began seeing a flashing light above me, and then when I walked down the hall I heard a voice, sounding kind of staticy, coming from my brothers room, all of these happened within a 40 second period. Should I be worried? I've had periods like this before, and I'm not particularly bothered by hallucinations unless they're keeping me awake or interfering with something I need to be doing, my delusions are much worse, but is there any way to avoid these little hallucination episodes?;
FinnsChips; I had a brief psychosis today, and now I'm at home recovering, and I realised just how exhausted I feel. I slept fine last night, during the episode I had zero fatigue, but now I'm so completely exhausted, I keep coming to the brink of passing out, and people keep telling me I sound very flat and completely emotionless. I can't quite remember this happening after other episodes, regardless of length or intensity. Is this normal?;
FinnsChips;" I can't remember the name of the film, but I went with my dad to see a horror movie in the cinema a few months ago, and I just wasn't able to get scared, because a lot of the things, such as people seeing things, looking away then checking again, only for the thing to be gone, or hearing noises, creaks, voices, all that, is just stuff I'm used to, and sure, it used to scare me, but now that I'm used to it whenever I see it in films my first thought is ""well this is clearly just a hallucination, how don't they get that?""";
FinnsChips; I can't just ignore them, when they speak to me I feel this intense need to respond which I can't ignore, I don't have this with any real people, but when it comes to the voices my psychosis creates I just have to respond, and it really irritates me because I get looks and questions when I'm seemingly talking to thin air. Is this normal?;
FinnsChips; I personally don't, mostly because every doctor I have has told me it is a very bad idea in my specific scenario, but I know some schizophrenics who can drive with no major issues. I'm mostly worried about my terrible concentration and disorganisation, but I'm also quite afraid about hallucinating while at the wheel. For those of you with your license, how have you managed?;
FinnsChips; I know the infamy this drug has, but in my case it isn't doing much of anything. I started on 150mg around a week and a half ago, then bumped it up to 300 a few days ago, but I'm still not feeling much of anything. My dreams are slightly more vivid, but I'm not any more tired. I'm 18 years old, diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, and weight just under 60 kilos, at just under 6 feet tall. Do I just keep bumping it up (with the all good from my doctors) until it starts knocking me out? My hallucinations are still just as bad too. Anyone with experience have any tips?;
FinnsChips; I don't know what to do now. My only coping mechanism is gone. I've tried other things but they never really worked, didn't even distract, but music always did. now the voices have infested that too. I can't manage this.;
FinnsChips; Since I started hearing voices more regularly when I was 15 whenever actual people speak lots of the time I either don't hear them or don't pay any attention because I have all these weird sounds going on constantly that they just blend into everything and make no sense. It's really starting to interfere with my daily life. Has anyone else experienced this?;
FinnsChips; Ever since I began developing schizophrenia my memory has been getting worse and worse. I used to have an almost photogenic memory so this was pretty scary when it began. It started with just forgetting stuff that didn't matter and that seemed reasonable to forget, but it keeps getting worse and I'm not sure when it's going to stop. At this point I forget what I was saying if I'm talking for more than a few seconds, I forget crucially important dates, I forget what my house looks like and I can't get around, I forget names, everything. I can't identify faces anymore, I'm hopeless in exams. Does it ever stop getting worse? At this point I'm getting scared because of the fact that it isn't letting up, every day I forget more and more.;
FinnsChips; A few weeks ago I was on a train. Some guy got on about an hour into the ride of three hours with his girlfriend. They sat down and she was being quite loud so I looked over for a second instinctively and he shouted at me. I just ignored him and went back to my music. Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me. I was quite afraid that he would be getting off at my stop and I wasn't sure what to do so I held onto my bag securely and started going over all the scenarios in my head that could happen, what he wanted and everything like that.;
FinnsChips; I'm beginning my first major episode since starting my meds and it's making me realise how much I hate this. The confusion, the paranoia, the memory loss, the dreams trying to control me, the hallucinations, the inability to do anything at all, I fucking hate it, I hate it, I hate it so much, I hate that I can't do anything, I fucking despise this.;
FinnsChips; I've never had this happen before, but I've been able to feel myself on the edge of a psychotic episode for a few days now, and I'm not sure when it's going to hit. What should I do beforehand to be sure I'll survive it? I'll let everyone know who needs to know, should i hospitalise myself? Is there a way to prevent it altogether? I'm already very unwell and not in need of an episode right now, so if there's a strategy people have used to stop an episode from hitting I could do with knowing.;
FinnsChips; Like most people here, I've experienced significant weight gain since starting Seroquel a few months ago, to the point where I'm considering changing meds. I've spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns I have surrounding it, but they seem to believe that it's not that bad, that I need to gain weight anyway so I might as well let it happen. While I do have a thin frame, that's a natural thing, putting on weight won't make me grow out, I'll just get a belly and it won't look good, not to mention be unhealthy, but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain. Is there anything I can do to change their mind, or at least have something to stop the weight gain? No matter how much I eat I'll put on weight, I went a few days without food and still put on weight, I'mnot sure how bad it's going to get and I really need something to help.;
FinnsChips; For me work isn't on the table for a while, I'm in my final year of school, once I'm done I'm going to uni, but with my disorder I can barely manage one thing, but once I'm done with uni I might look into work. Problem is, I don't know where to start. I'm thinking something simple and part time, but even getting a part time job needs a lot of things I just can't do. For those of you who work, how did you start out?;
FinnsChips; I've held a schizophrenia diagnosis for over a year now, with my first psychosis being diagnosed almost 3 years ago. Since then, the people who know, namely my family, expect me to function exactly the same as if I was healthy, even if I'm in the middle of an extremely intense episode. Now, a week ago I injured my knee, my kneecap dislodged, basically dislocated, out of the blue, quickly popped back in, went to see my gp the next day and it happened again, I'm on crutches now since I can't walk on it, and I'm getting scans done, it's likely that the recovery period will be a number of months, with surgery playing a part. Since then, everyone seems to be much more worried, nobody expects me to be up and out of the house constantly, nobody expects me to be fully functional and operating perfectly normally, even though this knee is bothering me much less than my schizophrenia does on any given day, and any psychotic episode is miles worse than not being able to walk, and it's really quite depressing how little people care about anything mental health related.;
FinnsChips; I was talking to my psychologist about some fairly annoying hallucinations I've been having a ton of recently, mostly stuff like constantly hearing a TV or a radio, seeing people coming towards me when I'm on a walk but then vanishing when they get close, or hearing someone walking around my house chatting away, and she seemed pretty bothered that my medication isn't stopping them as much as it should. They're definitely not as bad as they were when I was unmediated but they still bother me regularly, and it made me wonder if this is normal or if my medication should be blocking them more than it is. What kind of hallucinations do you all have on medication? Should I look into changing my meds up or is this normal?;
FinnsChips; I'm clean for about a week and a half, but tonight the urge is unbearable, I can't think of anything but dragging a blade through my skin, it's ruining me, I can't function like this, it is so brutal. Does anyone know what I mean?;
FinnsChips; For those of you who self harm but also struggle with smoking or drug abuse, how does self harm compare in terms of addiction? Does self harm feel like it is just as addicting? I'm curious how self harm fares against other addictions.;
FinnsChips;" So I was at school today, and my year was lining up for some assembly that we had on. I was wearing long sleeves on this particular day, but i had been wearing short sleeves for the past week or so (I'm a guy with many scars/scarring marks from self harm on my arm). I was messing around with a few of my friends and then we all walked off to start lining up when a girl who I knew by seeing her in the library for exams (I do special provisions and she must as well) came up to me. I'd never spoken to her before, all i knew about her was that she was in my year, and i think i knew her name. She asked me if i was okay, and I sort of stared at her for a few seconds, not really understanding what she meant, when she said ""i've seen cuts, and my friend also pointed them out to me. Is everything okay?"" She seemed genuinely concerned, and i think that's what threw me, because usually when people see my scars (I have scars on my outer and inner forearm, upper arm/shoulder, right thigh and both of my ankles/lower legs) they will just say something like ""Have you been cutting yourself Finn?"" in an annoyingly jokey voice, or ""are you really that emo?"" or they'll just say ""what the fuck happened to your arm/leg?"" When she asked me like she did, and seemed genuinely worried and concerned, I just sort of stood there like an idiot, stammering about how I was fine, and she sort of half hugged me, then i went off to go to line up. Has anyone else had any experiences like this or did I just get lucky to find someone who cares?";
FinnsChips; I remember a couple months ago I was having a particularly horrible night so I made around 60 long cuts on a clean part of my thigh, they weren't super deep, but I didn't feel a thing. I didn't feel relief or pain or anything, it was like nothing had even happened. I had to dig into fat before I could actually feel it. Does anyone else experience this, and is there a reason why this happens?;
FinnsChips; My thigh is so badly scarred there are like fifty layers of scarring and it's impossible to count how many there are because they overlap so much I don't even know how I managed to do so much damage over only like a year. My ankles are pretty damaged too but nowhere near as bad as my thigh and my shoulder was my old favourite place to cut so that's kinda bad too. My left forearm is pretty butchered but nothing super bad. No idea why I even wrote this, I'm tired and needed to rant.;
FinnsChips;" Not implying that I could ever control it completely, but when I began cutting last year it wasn't too bad, I don't think I did it daily, and they weren't deep marks, nobody knew and it was a secret thing. Then it gradually got worse. I moved from my arm to my shoulder, then down to my thigh, which is where it got really bad. My parents found out about it at some point and got me therapy which doesn't help at all, I'vee changed therapists multiple times and I just don't have the energy to try and get better. I remember when I started cutting daily and I would limit it to one cut. One single mark every night and that was all I needed. Then I attempted suicide. After this it got better, I decided to go clean, I was clean from self harm for a month and a half before I found myself carving ""I am useless"" into my thigh. Then the cutting began again, but it got worse again. I was constantly doing it, not just once a day but sometimes up to a hundred times a day, maybe even more. I started cutting everywhere I could, the only places I haven't cut at this point are my face, my neck, my knees and my back. My chest and stomach I barely ever cut so they aren't scarred, but my thigh, arm, shoulder, leg, ankles and hip are ruined. This brings me to where I am today. I'm not better at all. Since I began getting help I've been getting so much worse, I'm always cutting, always thinking about cutting, always thinking about suicide and death and what would happen after death. I'm so fucked up an I don't know what to do. I'm a mess, my body is a mess and I've only been cutting for a year. ";
FinnsChips; Recently I told my friend that I have decided to go clean from self harm for a bit, making it very clear that I will almost definitely relapse at some point. Now, this friend also suffers from self injury and has schizophrenia. After telling her this, she was happy that I had decided to go clean again, but today she messaged me saying that if I cut again she'll commit suicide. I'm fucking terrified, she's attempted suicide multiple times before and I have talked her out of it a few times as well, but I know I will relapse again and I'm terrified because she's threatening her life if I do. I'm so scared, I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose her but I also know that I will cut at some point in the future, and it'll be my fault that she's dead if she follows through with what she said. Does anyone know what I can do?;
FinnsChips;" They turned out to have a job at the store I was at, and they glanced at me, the paint scraping blade in my right hand and the scars on my left arm and just had that ""I'm not even surprised"" look on their face. I found it quite funny honestly.";
FinnsChips; Most of my scars are on my thigh, but I cut my left arm a fair bit too, enough to have it scarred up quite badly, and, although I have scars on my right arm too, they're so close to being invisible and there's barely any of them so my arm is basically clean. I've noticed that I always like to show that I have a clean arm, I'll gesture with it all the time, if I'm sitting down I'll lie it on the table so that people can see that is is unscarred, I just use it all the time. I don't really hide my scars unless it's cold enough to do so, so it's kind of obvious my left arm is scarred up anyway. Does anybody else do this if they have a clean arm?;
FinnsChips; I'm kinda in a mood to tell this story, and feel free to put your first cutting deep incident in the comments. My first time was in June last year. I was cutting a lot at the time, although I didn't even find it an issue, it was just something I did. I was cutting my shoulder a lot at the time, and I got home from school, went into my room, grabbed my blade and got to work. Now, this was a blade from a shaving razor I had taken apart, it was the sharpest blade in the razor, I didn't know this at the time, so I put the blade to my shoulder and cut. I immediately panicked, the cut was gaping open and I could see a bit of weird yellow bubbly stuff in it, which I later learnt was fat. The cut was bleeding a ton so I was trying to stop the bleeding with about a million tissues, I knew I needed stitches but I wasn't about to tell anyone what I had done. After about half an hour my mum came into my room to remind me that I had a tutoring lesson and we had to leave. I freaked the fuck out, my shoulder was still gaping open, although the bleeding had slowed down.;
FinnsChips; Basically, I'm a guy with many scars on my arm, and I'm going to need to shave my face at some point, so I was wondering if people can refuse to sell me razors if they see my scars.;
FinnsChips; So I've been thinking a lot about my self harming recently (I'm 15 days clean atm so of course I spend every second wanting to relapse) and I have noticed that I was never too aware of why I was cutting as badly as I was. I think that the reason I have done it so much in such a short space of time is that I get kind of curious to see how far I can go, if that makes sense. I sort of can't even feel the pain anymore, I just do it out of curiosity if that makes sense. I would sort of spread it out around my body, and I got really curious to see how much I could take. I'm fascinated by how easy it is for me to fuck my body up for life, and now I'm starting to realise that I was seeing how far I could go, how much I could cover myself in scars. Does anybody else get me, or has anyone else felt the same way?;
FinnsChips; I'm currently in a psychiatric ward for the first time in my life, I arrived yesterday and I'm here for three weeks because apparently I'm just fucking insane or something. It's a youth hospital, ages 16 to 30, and I've been scanning the other patients arms for signs of self injury. I have many scars myself, most are hidden as they're on my thigh or ankles and I wear jeans all the time, but my arm is also pretty butchered from wrist to elbow. Today in group therapy I was just casually scanning everyone's arms, as us self harmers do, and I saw that the girl next to me had a few spots on her arm that looked to be caused by skin picking. I looked over to my left and saw a guy who had sleeves that he had rolled up to reach his elbows, and I saw a pretty large amount of scars from cutting and burning on both of his arms, and they were very bad, like some scars were very deep.;
FinnsChips;" I was in a doctor who merch shop in the outskirts of Sydney with my mum today, and the guy at the counter was pretty talkative, I was chatting to him a fair bit about all the items in the store, and keep in mind this guy looks to be in his mid fifties, so he isn't too in touch with kids these days (hello r/fellowkids), and when we were buying our stuff he was talking to us and suddenly asked: ""what are those scars from man, what've you been doing? You travel back in time and meet up with sid vicious? I fake laughed while feeling my anxiety skyrocket. I have a lot of scars on my arm, obviously self inflicted, and although they're all pretty old some are still purple and obvious. My mum also fake laughed, and then started talking to the guy about sid vicious quickly to change the subject, they began talking about punk bands and I went off to continue browsing to try and calm my anxiety when I overheard the guy talking about how ""all kids these days are depressed and anxious and on meds and all this shit, those are just normal human emotions, they're all killing themselves for stupid reasons."" At this point in time I'm in a mental ward and was on leave for a couple of hours to go shopping which was why I was at this store, and my mum was of course aware of this, but she didn't say anything to him.";
FinnsChips; For me personally my brother is 13, I'm 16, and for a while I wasn't sure if he knew about my depression or anxiety or psychosis or bipolar or anything, and he probably thought that our cats really hated me for a while, but recently I went to hospital for three weeks and my parents probably told him why (my parents are horrible at not telling people about my issues). He's fairly absent minded and generally gets easily distracted and I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't know what self harm is, but I've got scars all over and I have no idea what he thinks happened.;
FinnsChips; Mine was yesterday, I had special provisions for an exam and I was in a room with a few other kids, I was sitting in the back corner and I had taken a paper clip with me, and I used it to scratch my thigh, ankle and knee enough to draw blood. Funny thing was the teacher was supposed to be making sure we weren't doing anything like that but clearly she either was completely blind or she just didn't care.;
FinnsChips; I was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars, all over both her wrists, both her forearms, upper arms, thighs, legs, ankles, stomach, just completely covered in them. This got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm, and I realised I'm that kid. I'm not completely covered in scars, but my ankles are scarred pretty badly, my arm, which is probably where most people look, is covered in cuts, scars and burns, I don't even hide it anymore because it's so hot (I'm talking like 42℃, where I physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out), and I'm that kid who people will stare at when he's walking to class, they might whisper to their friends about my arm, the teachers will see my arm and just assume that I'm just another emo, I don't even do anything in class because I'm so depressed that I just don't have the energy to work so I must just look like a massive poser. I'm always on the lookout for others with scars like mine, but there's nobody with them.;
FinnsChips; For example, my first time ever self harming that I can remember was in mid 2014, I didn't even consider it self harm at the time, but I threw myself off my bike going at speed down an incline. I ended up scarring my ankles, knees, hand and elbows as well as spraining my ankle. Has anyone else self harmed in a way that nobody ever really mentions when it comes to self harm, yet would technically be considered self harm?;
FinnsChips;" I was waiting at a bus stop with my sleeves rolled up and some old guy, looked about 70 and pretty high, came up to me and said I looked like a muso. I laughed and said I was and then he looked at my arm and said ""you've got a fair few scars there haven't you?"" I just laughed like they were nothing and then he said ""I've got my fair share of scars too."" He began indicating to areas he had scars, I figured he was just reminiscing about the old days and those scars he got taking apart a railroad or some shit when he indicated to his fingers and said ""got the letters E Z on these, did it with a knife on a cutting board.""";
FinnsChips;" I have this weird habit of staring at my inner forearm in public and at home. The scars there are probably about 3 months to just over a year old, and I kind of like the way they look, which is probably weird but especially for me, because whenever I look at the scars on my outer forearm I hate them for being so visible and STILL so red after six months of ""healing,"" but the scars on my inner forearm almost... satisfy me. They aren't even very deep at all, nothing compared to my thigh, but I like staring at them anyway.";
FinnsChips; This is going to be triggering, so please leave now if graphic detail of self harm upsets you. Now, I cut myself 5 or so times on my thigh around an hour ago, they weren't deep but also weren't shallow, probably all around the dermis somewhere, maybe a couple grazing the top of fat tissue. I let them bleed for a long while before cleaning up but I realised I suddenly felt very dizzy, it's been getting worse and worse, I feel nauseous and fatigued as well. I'm assuming they're blood loss related as I wasn't having any of these symptoms before I created the wounds. They did bleed a pretty significant amount, should I be worried? I feel like I'm going to just pass out soon.;
FinnsChips; I'm not entirely sure how this would even work, but imagine like a typical razor blade, but made out of like a hard sort of rubber, and when you used it on yourself it would create sort of fake blood in a line and would look like you cut. I'm trying to find cutting distractions rn and this would be so amazing I feel. Probably making no sense, sorry, and it probably sounds dumb, but if it was possible that would be something amazing to be sold for recovering cutters to buy. Just a dumb idea, soz.;
FinnsChips; Sometimes I'll just look at my body and realise that I'll never get my clean unscarred skin back, I don't even really care about my scars that cover so much of my thigh that the skin there isn't even visible anymore, I don't care about the small red and pink lines that travel all over my inner ankles, my shoulder scars that travel down halfway down my upper arm I couldn't give less of a shit about, it's my arm that makes me feel sick every time I look at it. It isn't even scarred as badly as some other people's that I've seen, but the scars that lace around my inner forearm from wrist to elbow, slowly working their way around to start tracing over my outer forearm, burn scars mixing in to make it seem a billion times worse, and the scars that sit on the side of my inner forearm that I did when I was too scared to cut over my vein, those scars are the ones that constantly give me mental breakdowns, the scars that I've tried to fade to no avail, the scars that get me stared at when it's too hot to cover up, the scars that I wish I could have just done on my thigh so they could be hidden at least a bit, the scars that I hate myself for spreading out all over my arm, the scars that will never fade and will always sadden me whenever I look at my left forearm.;
FinnsChips; I recently watched Black Panther, and there is a character in that who scars himself for every person he kills. This got me thinking about how self harm is shown in movies or TV. This guy seemed to just do it as a ritualistic thing, although there's a batman villain who cuts himself every time he kills someone, and he reveals that he got into it because of the rush it gave him, a couple of the main characters from the first AHS season cut, one of the main characters from Orphan Black cuts herself on her back, and she is often seen as the more insane character, and all this made me realise that self harm is often seen as a very dramatic, extreme, even insane behaviour.;
FinnsChips; I don't hide my arm. My scars there range from 1 month to just over a year old. The scars are pretty noticeable, but I am not attention seeking by not hiding them, I simply can't deal with the heat and the uncomfortable feeling of wearing long sleeves while everyone else is comfortably wearing short sleeves, and getting people telling me to take my jumper off like they did back when I hid my scars like the plague. I have scars on my ankles, my thigh, my shoulder, and my hip as well, and I hide my ankle scars, and the shoulder, thigh and hip scars are hidden easily by my clothes since I'm male, but I only hide my ankles because they have fresher marks on them, when they're older I won't hide them. The ones on my thigh are very extreme, there are an insane amount of scars and some are quite deep, and I refuse to let anyone get a glimpse of my thigh just because the scarring is so severe, but my arm, which is only moderately scarred, I won't hide. It's Australia, it gets extremely hot, wearing long sleeves is actually risking my health because of how hot it is, so no, I'm not attention seeking, I'm just choosing to not give a shit.;
FinnsChips; Does anyone else do this? I've self harmed in different ways throughout my life, as a kid I heard voices, had bizarre nonsensical paranoid beliefs and didn't know how to function in social situations, and I remember hitting myself in the head when I got stressed, or purposely pissing off my cat and then putting my hand near him and letting him tear it to shreds, or grinding my hand against a wall until it left marks. When I was 14 I began cutting, eventually began burning too, got a couple thousand scars as a result, I don't do it a ton anymore, but I've been punching walls daily for a while now, and I don't know why but it's just so satisfying. Getting pissed off and just being able to slam my fist into a wall, seeing the bruising, maybe even bleeding, it just feels good. I know I have potential to do real damage, and I've already accidentally knocked a tendon out of place doing it, but it just feels satisfying. Anyone else got experience with this?;
FinnsChips; Like if I ever see an image of someone with their inner left forearm in view and it's completely unscarred I feel confused as to how they kept their arm like that, or if I see girls in bikinis at the beach with their thighs glistening in their clean majesty it makes me realise how I'll never look like that (mainly because I'm male but you get what I mean).;
FinnsChips; Well, first time in a normal social environment. I saw at least ten people with scars during my 3 week psych ward stay, saw a girl who looked to be in her mid twenties in the mental health centre I attend with a lot of very parallel scars on her outer arm, and once had an old guy come up to me at a bus stop and tell me about the scars he gave himself when he was young, but today, at the orientation for my new school, I was sitting next to a guy, and at one point I looked over to look past him, but glanced a weird dark patch on his arm. I looked closer while being sure he couldn't see me looking, and immediately recognised it as a burn, having given myself so many I was able to determine when he had done it and how bad it was, and it looked to be very recent, around a few days old. I also saw a bunch more burns, and a lot of cut scars, lots of which also seemed recent, and some on the outer part of his ankle, which made me believe he had many more all over his body. The worst part was that it didn't even seem like a surprise that he had scars, he looked very unclean, like he hadn't showered in months, his hair was shoulder length and very greasy and matted, he was overweight and wearing clothes which looked unwashed and baggy, and he looked like the life had been sucked out of him a long time ago.;
FinnsChips;" In his videos about self injury, not only does he almost completely ignore all forms of self harm except for cutting, but he generalises all self harmers to be attention seekers, constantly stating that its ""only white privileged upper class girls' who cut, which shames those people who self harm who fit that description, and makes people like me who don't fit that description feel alienated and fake. He calls self harmers morons, crazy, psychopaths, idiots, fuckups, and says that people with ""real"" problems don't self harm, using two pictures of people in a bad position to generalize that absolutely nobody who's in an extremely bad state self harms. He ignores all statistics proving that African Americans are found by multiple studies to be the most likely to self injure and says instead that because tumblr is mostly white people, all self harmers must be white people. He repeatedly says that all self harmers are idiots for not getting therapy, again generalising that none of us are in therapy, and then he puts us down so much that, for me at least, he made me feel like I didn't deserve help, making me self harm much more, much worse, ending in a suicide attempt and hospitalisation.";
FinnsChips; So I just dug into my arm quite a bit, psychosis got a bit bad, and now my arm feels very numb and kind of cold, also quite hard to use. Should I get it seen to? Sorry for having to ask, just a bit worried.;
FinnsChips; It's common knowledge that self harm feels good, but today I had a slight slip up and burnt myself on my thigh. It wasn't too bad, only second degree, but I've felt extremely euphoric for about half an hour since I did it, and this is quite unusual. I feel kind of shakey, my heart rate has increased a small amount, and I feel so happy and relaxed. This feeling usually goes away after about 5 or 10 minutes, it hasn't ever lasted this long, and I have self injured thousands of times over the last few years. I'm not complaining, I feel amazing, but is there a reason this feeling is staying for so long and feels so good this time?;
FinnsChips;" Just carved DECAY into my lower thigh, near my calf, pretty deep, and afterwards I just thought ""yeah, that'll be there literally forever, whatever, who cares"" then I proceeded to accidentally lightly cut my left thigh, the thigh I literally never use for self harm aside from one scar that I don't remember making, so I was probably dissociated, and I'm still feeling real shit about it. The cut is minor but it's just enough to know that it'll leave a faint scar, and I'm mad pissed. Forget my bloody, carved up other leg with a fucking word on it that will be there until my fucking body, well, decays.";
FinnsChips; What's probably a really stupid thought just came to me. A few minutes ago I was sitting on the couch in my back room and burnt my calf with a lighter. My dog was lying on his bed watching me and when I looked at him he looked kind of confused. I don't want him suddenly thinking that fire is okay and safe because he saw me cooking my leg, can animals tell that something's wrong if they see someone doing it?;
FinnsChips; Same old story, grabbed my lighter after a few months clean, had a smoke but it didn't help so decided to cook my leg. I was sitting on the couch next to my dog who was lying there, about to fall asleep when I burnt myself, a bit into me making the burn he shot up and stared at me, I thought he was interested in the sound the lighter made but he was looking at me, not the lighter, making those big sad puppy eyes we all know from many nights of refusing to give our dogs a second dinner. Once I'd finished I tucked my lighter back into my pocket, sat there for a bit and after 20 seconds or so I started to slam my fist into my leg repeatedly out of frustration and he properly sat up, once i stopped he continued to give me this really sad look, I was sitting there for a few more minutes but he kept looking at me instead of going back to sleep, which isn't something he ever does. I tried to pat him until he would lie down again but he wouldn't, I eventually got up and walked off but he kept looking at me the whole time with the same sad eyes.;
