0,Some changes to our content guidelines and a couple reminders,"We're long overdue for a community announcement and there's some things to bring up that have been regularly voiced in submissions which I'd like to clarify. 

As you all know /r/happy is a place where we share stories and special moments that make us happy, that makes this an area where anyone is free to post as long as they follow the guidelines of this community. 

In the ""spirit of happiness"" the guidelines have always been very relaxed, the only hard requirement was to make your post about something personal/special. We've stuck with these guidelines for years but with our explosion in growth/attention this year it's become necessary to clarify things and set some rules which I'll try to explain here.

* **Always get consent** - All too often we get submissions that's a picture of a person sleeping or one that was likely meant to be private. There's no easy way to enforce this so consider this item more of a guideline to think about what you're posting, if you don't think the person would be happy about their picture being shared then make it a text post.

* **We'll now start referring users to post in theme/event related subreddits** - Everyone is welcome to post here *but* take a moment consider posting to one of the subreddits dedicated to what you're posting about. This can be pet, wedding, engagement, or birth pictures (there's a lot). The submission page has been updated to cover different subreddits a person may wish to be posting to instead, if there's others you feel should be included please leave a comment.

* **We will start enforcing the vague post rule** - We've been pretty lax about this one, submissions that are a one liner such as ""She makes me happy"" or ""I love my kids/dogs/tree/foot"" will removed. The intent is to share *stories*, we don't expect an essay but a description of why this picture is special to you. Text posts are even better if you feel the need to elaborate.

* **Trolls and harassing comments get a ban** - I'll keep it pretty simple: Trolls (intentionally harassing users) get a permanent ban. Users who post shaming/negative comments get a short ban (less than 7 days) that can be appealed very easily by responding to the ban message. Repeat offenders will be subject to longer bans that eventually become permanent.

* **Report, report, report and message the mods when that fails** - We've got personal lives and family outside reddit so we're not always around to remove comments/submissions. You help keep the community a happy place by reporting things you feel violate the rules or need attention. Above all else please feel free to message the mods about anything that concerns you.

* **Our CSS sucks and we're not good at it** - reddit theme changes broke our CSS a long time ago and we've gotten complaints, unfortunately we don't have the time to fix it but there will be some changes coming soon that will help us throw that all out. In the meantime if you feel you can help us fix it just reach out.

 I currently have a friend who is rooting for me even when my depression won‚Äôt let me root for myself. 

She asked me earlier this week how applying to jobs was going and I kind of brushed it off. We work at the same company but I‚Äôm currently unhappy in my position and have been very open with her. I‚Äôve also been going through a depressive episode lately which hasn‚Äôt led to much motivation or energy to change my situation. 

After I nonchalantly brushed her off I received a text the next morning. It was a date/time that we were going to meet and complete multiple job applications and even construct emails for jobs I‚Äôve applied to previously. She even picked me up to make sure I made it. 

We worked together for 3.5 hours which might not seem like a lot to some but for someone who can‚Äôt focus to save her life it‚Äôs pretty impressive. I‚Äôve now got multiple job applications submitted, follow up emails sent as well as some schedule for the future.

She was and still is the thing i love the most in this difficult world. Her passing hurt me so much and i'm still working on it. Last night, i got so sad and i didn't know why, i had a decent day and then all of a sudden, i was crying, and feeling shitty.. i talked to a friend and i was basically saying everything i'm bad at. Saying ""i need my grandma"".. i went to bed bc i was tired of crying quietly in my room, and i didn't want to annoy my friend and my phone was on 1%...
Anyways, I went to sleep and something personal happened.. we told the guy (13) and the mom and my Uncle and Aunt about what he did... then i went into another room and there she was.. my grandma! she wasn't sick anymore she was smiling and okay! she basically said she loves me and that she's ok.. she accepted how much i love her and said ""i love u as much as u love me"" and we hugged.. then i woke up.. burst into tears, woke up my sister, told her what happened. then my mom walks in and my sister says ""she had a nightmare"" and i said ""i- i didn't, we told the guys mom what he did.. then i saw oma and she was okay and smiling and said she loved me"" my mom then said ""i had a feeling she would come to you first, she's telling you she is okay where she is and loves you, and that's the best dream you can have"" 
ITS TRUE! i was so sad and depressed last night that all i wanted was Oma (grandma) and to hug her.. AND THATS WHAT HAPPENED!! She's watching over me and she happy.. and- knowing she's watching me is almost like a closure of me wondering ""is she ok"" bc now i know she is!!! the fact that she was in my dream, before my siblings and her daughter and her son just shows that she loves me just as much as i love her.. and i'll be ok now.. i can't stop crying happy tears... üòÖüòÅ ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíô

64,"After a very hard work week, one of my tenants called me and made my week!","Sorry in advance, I've never posted to this sub and this is going to be a little long but I wanted to share this uplifting experience;

To preface, I work as a building manager dealing with the day to day dealings and issues in a large apartment complex. My job can be very draining, as well as physically and emotionally exhausting. This week was very hard as I had an issue with a resident being very volatile and many of the residents were upset and unfortunately I am the first face they see when that happens so I get a lot of negative words and insults thrown my way. 

I came home today and I am on call and one of my tenants names popped up on the after hours phone and I picked up (as you do), ready to get another grievance regarding the disruptive tenant. What I got instead was completely the opposite, I don't usually speak much about my residents however this wonderful person is someone that I feel I need to talk about. This tenant is so so lovely, she is so sweet and in every interaction she tells me how much she loves living here and that she is so happy with how the place has changed for the better since I took over. She asked to extend her lease and told me that I was kind and wonderful. I needed to hear that after this week, she is so full of kindness and support, she works with children with disabilities and her patience and grace comes through in everything she does, she even said how grateful she was that I answered the phone even though it was after hours (I was off about 2 hours ago). She also said that she had lived in a complex when she was in her youth and was happy to see more activities that I had started doing to get to know your neighbors better. She made my whole day.

 Her and people like her are the reason that the world has safe places and light in a world that can at times feel unrelenting and bleak. If you are on this subreddit you are a person who contributes to that and I thank you."

I have this curtain way of making them that I love so much :) First, instead of using cooking spray on the pan, I use butter to add to the flavour of the pancake. I make the batter as normal, then I add cinnamon into the batter. Once I put it onto the pan on the stove, I put in white chocolate chips and sometimes blueberries. Lastly I serve them with blueberries ontop and some strawberries on the side and sometimes with whip-cream.

But I've very recently discovered that while I've been living a happy and satisfying life, I haven't been living happy. Day to day is routine, my love for others has been in my words and actions. But something was missing. The emotional component.
Maybe a dozen or two times in those 15 years has that emotion flowed through me. Then, probably triggered by the ending of the TV show TGP, I dug for that emotion. I found it. Waves of joy. I gave a family member a hug and not only *said* I loved her, but expressed it, felt it. I did the same with my roommate. Then my wife. 

With some work, I hope to keep this flow going. To continue living not just a happy life, but to live happy."

I hoarded medication in my car because I needed to know I had a way out if I couldn't carry on. I've been with him since we were 16, we're now 26. He's everything to me. This time last year I thought I'd be getting a divorce for my first wedding anniversary. Just before our anniversary we had the most painful conversation of my life, but it was the start of fixing our relationship. We never went on a honeymoon but I woke up on our first anniversary in a stunning hotel room in Amsterdam which he had arranged and paid for only telling me the day before we left. It was a gesture of commitment and appreciation and it was the best holiday we'd ever had also a good way to heal after a painful few months.

He's on a journey of self improvement and slowly becoming the husband I always knew he could be.

Now we are trying for a family and I could be heavily pregnant for our second anniversary. Things could not be more different than they were a year ago.

The icing on the cake is a phone call I just received from him regarding his university course. When we were kids at college he didn't attend for a solid 6 months due to depression. Stark comparison to today were he called me to tell me he's finishing his degree with a 2:1. I'm honoured to have been with him on his journey to becoming this incredible person. 

Words absolutely fail to describe how proud I am of him."

I went to live with my brother for about 5 months and learned acceptance and love, and most importantly learning my own interests and healthy habits. Coming back home I realized.. my favorite color is pink! 

I have been going to the gym every day and eating healthy, I have learned to sew, felt and cook. I realized the things I want to wear and want to strive for! I want to learn to garden and plant! I want to learn many things, and I want a job and degree to get those things! (I used to be very against college and education in general) I'm not sure how to explain it, but I can see colors differently too. This is my first time happy in 6 years, and I hope this feeling never ends"

107,Babies/toddlers saying hello to random people is my favorite thing,"So I was in the waiting room of a doctors office when a woman came with her daughter, who looked to be about 2-3? I dunno but she was old enough to walk. And as her mom is checking in she wanders over to me and places a hand on my knee and says ""Hi"" in the cutest little voice. At that point her mom comes over and takes her away but like... That just made me so happy

My whole life ive felt invisible, like nobody notices or cares that I'm around, it has been especially true as of late and it really brings me down. But those moments when *someone*, *anyone* notices me, even if its for a moment, even if its just a baby... It makes me feel so much better. It makes me feel like i actually exsist and that the whole world isnt actually trying to ignore me. That little girl saying hi to me was def the highlight of my day."

I was about to drive out of our driveway with the car when suddenly a guy on a bike appeared on my left. He wanted to cross the sidewalk in front of me.

I indicated him to pass on which he responded with a waving gesture for me to drive out first. But because I was in a good mood, I wanted him to pass first. So was he.

We ended up throwing gestures at each other so the other one will finally pass.

In the end, he passed our driveway and because I was driving in the same direction as him, I waved him goodbye and I drove past him and he laughed and waved back.

Just a wholesome little story."

124,‚ÄúSome things are more important‚Äù - the little things mean a lot.,"Didn‚Äôt know where to post this so I just looked up keywords to find somewhere.. came here. 

I‚Äôve been having the worst anxiety at night recently for no apparent reason. My hubby falls asleep before me. 

It was particularly bad last night and in his sleep, he flopped over, garbled out ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù And held onto me... I asked him several times what he said, what he was doing, etc. No response. Finally, I leaned my head into his chest and listened to his heart‚Äôs calm beat. I immediately felt  a wave of tiredness and fell into a peaceful sleep. 

I woke up this morning and he had no recollection and seemed shocked to find out about it. He kept telling me I should‚Äôve woken him up, no matter how deep in sleep he was and he would‚Äôve helped. I reminded him that he kinda did even without realising. Even while asleep, he was trying to comfort me.

He was getting ready for work while I made his breakfast and immediately dropped his bag to hug me from behind around the waist and tell me it would be okay, he‚Äôs there, etc. I thanked him but told him if he didn‚Äôt let go and get moving, he‚Äôd be late for work. His response?

‚ÄúSome things are more important.‚Äù :^)

I always help him in the morning before work and he kept stopping me to hug/kiss/or just screw around with me to make me smile/laugh. I was so worried he‚Äôd be late but it seems he JUST made it in time. Before he left, he declared we were having pizza, beer, and watching some anime when we‚Äôre both home tonight and I just got so happy over the idea of him thinking ahead for ‚Äúus time‚Äù, even though it‚Äôs not really a new thing. 

Idk man I just had to post this because literally just being around him is the best and makes me all fuzzy... even 8 years later. It still feels like when we first met. Idk how I got so lucky. 

Even when he left, he texted me the same stuff he was saying and.. my heart is happy."

I see a bright future ahead. Especially if Bernie sticks to his guns and doesn‚Äôt back down out of fear. 

I feel like America as a whole is slowly starting to be aware of the fact that we‚Äôre a first world country without universal healthcare. And insane education prices. The capitalistic nature of the economy. And how no one cares for the benefit of the lower class. 

Something in my gut is telling me everything regarding our future will turn out A-ok. Who‚Äôs with me..?"
132,This is still one of my fave memories ever...,"It all began during the Summer Solstice in 2016. My daughter Xan and I had been carrying on into the wee hours of the morning with friends; a true release. Xan immediately gravitated to Melissa; connecting on an almost spiritual level. The following morning, as I entered the kitchen area, I witnessed my daughter and Melissa collaborating on this song. All three of us were going through different aspects of healing at the time; Xan had just recently been released from the psych where she'd been hospitalized for major depression and suicidal ideation; I'd recently separated from an abusive and toxic ex, and this was the first song that Melissa wrote and produced since regaining her voice after several months of being mute from a mysterious ailment that still has doctors scratching their heads. 

Fast forward to this video shoot. This  shoot was for the NPR Tiny Desk Concert series and is one of my favorite memories to date. Watching this video makes me so happy because it reminds me how far we have all come.   (Please excuse the sound quality but **listen** to the lyrics, which my daughter helped write. They are quite inspiring if I may say so myself.) 

Enjoy!

133,I bonded with my dad and it was wonderful,"After nearly 20 years, I took the initiative to have a proper heart to heart conversation with my dad. He used to be this strict and disciplined person while I was growing up so never really interacted with him on an emotional basis. I also resented him a lot. 

But today, I felt like it was now or never and I took the opportunity to talk. We talked about our childhoods and his struggles and everything in between. There were tearful moments too. I realized I missed out on many things but at the end of the day I am happy that I got to know the real him, the emotional person that he is and we successfully achieved the first step towards mending our relationship.

I can tell him anything and everything now without a filter, only complete honesty. I am so glad it happened. I am proud of us, Dad."

146,"Today is my 30th birthday. My awesome mum recreated the cake she made me when I turned 4, which was always my favourite!",
147,Hello awesome people of reddit. Today I realised that I've reached that point in life where I am what I always wanted to be and I'm supremely happy :),"I always wanted to be a successful entrepreneur while not falling for the usual trap of becoming a heartless asshole capitalist. I'm running a successful business from last 10 years with around 100 employees and I am proud to say that even though I've been in situations where I could've made more money by taking advantage of them, I never did that, let go of some very good opportunities of making a lot of money but still never did that, most of the people in my company are working from a loooong time and have not left the job, I must've been doing something right.

Despite my everyday struggle with ADHD and not being good at academic scene, I've taught myself SO MANY things by myself that I'm just really super proud of it.

In addition to all that, Ive been a really good and supportive member of my extended family, helping a lot of younger kids by going out and breaking a lot of shitty norms of caste, gender, religion and race, even by risking my position in society at the risk of becoming an outcast from my family, it all turned out well, they all still like and respect me and are now emulating me by getting out of these shackles and standing up against narrow mindedness in their milieu.

I've helped my parents a lot in their old age and apparently they are also really proud of me (their words, not mine).

So all in all, despite not getting a good education, coming from lower middle class economic background, addled with issues like ADHD and Dyslexia, I'm the guy who has made it. Got the girl I love (way before business and success), happily married six years now, have a successful business which I started myself from scratch without any financial help from my friends or family or VCs and am running it from 10 years successfully without selling my soul, made around 60 people really happy by giving them jobs they otherwise wouldn't have gotten and seeing them thrive just gives me so much joy. All this while also being a good wholesome member of my society and family.

It makes me really happy to suddenly realise that this is all I wanted to be and how awesome it is to be me. I feel so blessed and grateful.

Yay me. :D"

 ‚ÄúWhenever you are about to start on some activity, remind yourself what the activity is like,‚Äù 

 

Think about how things *really* might be in advance. Don‚Äôt tell yourself how you want them to be. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself as a form of motivation. Be honest.

If they end up being better than you expect , then wonderful. If they end up being anything else? Well, you‚Äôre prepared now.

Better to be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly surprised. Better to be realistic than delusional.

246,"The past five years, I've managed to work down so much of my inner anger and hatred that it has brought on an elevated state of calmness and inner joy.

How does everyone here manage with anger?","In the past, anger resulted in a lot of errors of judgments, it ruined friendships, and it destroyed all peace of mind. Consequently, I experienced no joy, healthy relationships, or luck and fortune. This is why it was so important for me to be mindful of my anger and learn to manage it in a healthy way that ensures it diminishes over time.

After five years, I've managed to make great progress and feel a new person. Thoughts of anger, hatred, and ill-will no longer plague my mind and influence my actions and speech. In a sense, I feel great liberation and freedom from it. I feel so much more patience, empathy and calmness day to day and can naturally carry a smile to share with others, something I thought only psychopaths did.

I made a [video](https://youtu.be/_DCsHV7Mmbc) to share how I understand anger, and detail the best ways to not only manage it but even use it to make us better people. By using kindness, patience and insight, I feel equipped to deal with life's obstacles, but also no longer fear the hatred and ill thoughts of others.

255,My son got on the Honor Roll for the 1st time!,"To understand how HUGE this is for him I have to share a little back story. My kid went to a very tiny private school since Kindergarten. With small classroom sizes & where everyone knows eachother and their parents type environment.

My kid struggled with being organized and writing down assignments. He would often forget about upcoming tests or papers due. I would find unfinished homework shoved in his unorganized notebook, or in the back of his desk. When I would meet with teachers they would share that often times after they have given the lesson and assign the in-class work my son would look around and be clueless. Asking, what are we doing? How do we do this... etc? The Teacher would say, ""I just went over it with everyone"".  And sometimes they could go over again with him, but sometimes the time wouldn't allow. I remember studying with him for tests coming up, only to find out he didn't do well. Many tears were shed. School was hard for him and his confidence was starting to dwindle. He started calling himself stupid and self harming himself. which broke my Mama heart. Because he is such a good kid. He's kind to everyone, respectful, helpful and just a thoughtful person.  

After his 4th grade year the principal had a meeting with me about him and the upcoming 5th grade year. She shared her concerns for his success & highly suggested that I medicate him and to also hold him back & repeat the 4th grade. This was gut wrenching to hear. His already low self-esteem would certainly take a hit. He wouldn't be with the same classmates he's had since kindergarten. He would then also be in his younger brothers class (who has no problems with school), and at this age kids are self aware and they talk. I felt so distraught for him. Plus, I didn't understand how repeating a grade and doing nothing else different was going to help him. Because this is such a small private school, they can't accommodate (or have the resources) children that don't fit into the ""norm"". 

I made the hard decision to pull him from the only school he's known and enroll him in the public school system, which had the funding and resources available to help him. He started his 5th grade year there. It was awful hard on him. Everything was new. New, building, new teachers, kids, and curriculum. We soon started him on the evaluation process, which took some time and eventually got him on his own IED plan.  This was HUGE!! 

Come to find out my kid struggles with reading/comprehension. It's hard to do the assessments when you don't know what you just read. Also, he gets anxious if he feels he's slower then the other kids so he wouldn't take his time to understand or do the assignment right & just scribble something down to turn it in. Once we were able to find the problem we were able to address it and tackle it head on. He had a team of supporters at this new school helping him how he needed it. Once the IEP plan was put in place he thrived!

Well, my kid is now in the 6th grade. He has an IEP plan in place and he is rocking it! He finishes his homework on his own, and he's getting A's & B's. It is So SO SOOO amazing to see his confidence built back up. The school posted on FB the kids that made the Honor Role, and for the first time in his life his name was on it. My heart BEAMED with happiness for my son. I know that changing schools (as hard as it was on him) was the BEST thing for him. 

I'm So proud of my son, It is truly a joy in life to see your children overcome an obstacle and succeed. I am happy."

275,I've finally found something that makes me want to fight my mental illness,"~~This might be kinda long but there's a tldr at the end lol~~ 

So, I've been wrestling with depression and anxiety for a good part of my life, especially anxiety. I have had social anxiety since a very young age, which I have been able to cope with, but more recently I developed quite severe illness anxiety, or hypochondriasis. It's more specific than that but I won't get in-depth about it. It controls my life and holds me back constantly, and when I'm not anxious I'm pretty much completely lethargic from depression.

However, I never felt the need to seek further help than getting medication prescribed that temporarily helps me calm down. Although desperate to give myself a meaning in life, I've never found something I truly enjoy doing, or see myself doing long term, whether it be studies, a job path, hobby, etc. So I never saw the point in getting better.

That is until recently. I know full well this is going to sound stupid to some, but just over a week ago I randomly decided to start streaming video games. Obviously my first ever stream was a flop with an audience of one, which was my friend showing me support and me talking to myself most of the time. But despite that, I felt something that I'm positive I haven't felt in years: passion, enjoyment, the want to continue and improve, and those feelings got stronger the more I streamed.

The first couple of days I started streaming were on my good days, where my anxiety wasn't as bad as usual and I could actually get up and do stuff to a certain extent. Unfortunately, on maybe the third day, I was hit with it again. Crippling anxiety, panic attacks and pretty much constantly terrified that I was going to die. I took medication and tried to stream again, but I ended up having to cut it off early and had an overall bad stream because of how I was feeling. I think I managed to stream again the next day, but I couldn't at all for the following 3-4 days.

It fucking sucked. I finally found something that I enjoy doing and that actually gets me out of bed in the morning, and I'm being held back by... myself. There was no way I was going to drop this and just let myself spiral into complete inactivity again. I *want* to do this. It sparks enjoyment and makes me feel fulfilled no matter how small or non-existent my audience is. It ultimately makes me want to DO something, whatever it is, and I've never had that before. I don't want anything to take that away from me.

Yeah it probably sounds stupid that what has inspired me is *Twitch streaming* of all things, but it doesn't matter **what** it is, it could've been anything in the world, the point is that I've found something I want to do and that makes me want to heal. 

I finally wanted to get help. I'm going to see my doctor, find a therapist and try everything until something works for me. I'm not going to give up this time or tell myself ""It's not worth it"" or ""It probably doesn't work anyways"" or some other excuse.

&#x200B;

**I'm going to get better and I'm so fucking happy about it.**

&#x200B;

TLDR: I've never had a passion or real motivation before until I started streaming games recently, but I'm being held back by my mental health, which has given me the push to finally get proper help and heal for the first time in my life."

292,This person made me feel like I was worth something. It was the first time that I truly felt that I was genuinely important to someone.,"Here is the backstory: This person I didn‚Äôt talk to at all. I rarely even seen this person. 2 years ago, This all change when there was an event organized by the university where a celebrity comes and talks to the students. She and I got VIP bracelets. I won the contest out of 5 people and since she worked for the event, she was the check in clerk. She got VIP as well. After the event concluded. She offered to take a picture of me with the celebrity. I will not mention the celebrity. She also took a picture with the celebrity. She would smile at me several times after that. This was the beginning of it. 7 months passed by and I got her for two classes and she would smile at me and make direct eye contact. She would sit next to me like more than 5 times. I kid you it was like 10 times. Oh boy, at one point, she said hi and I as well. When she was absent, I would get the missing work for the classes I had her in. She would continue to smile at me. There was several times where I went to the game room in the Student Union and I went to play and she jokingly and playful said that I didn‚Äôt like playing those games referring to the Legend of Zelda type of games where it was true but I never said that to her. She knew I like Soccer but that was it. And honestly that was cool and sweet. when 4 months passed by, we outta of nowhere saw each other and we chat and said how we our day and how long do we need to graduate and what classes we were taking and how many left. 9 months passed by and I briefly saw her but I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her because she was working with an event outside and I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt her. Oh boy, she finished fast because I was like 15 feet away. She was excited to see because she finished what she was doing to talk to me. She didn‚Äôt care for anybody at that moment but me. She walked fast to get where I was I believe because it was some what a mid long distance where I was and was and boy, when she got to where I was, she immediately saw me and told me, hi, how are you? and then we talked for like 4 minutes and then at the end of the conversation, she said It was lovely talking to you and boy that melted my heart. I can hear in mind how she speaks tbh."

It completely fucked up my social circle and kicked out almost 60% of it. I lost every ounce of self confidence and positivity I had. As an extrovert and usually fun going, sociable person, this really fucked me up. But since September, I have been working on myself a lot. I try to talk to as many new people as I can. There was this boy on Instagram that would make pretty good memes. I never really talked to him before but I thought he was pretty cool and it would be great to talk to him one day. So I replied to one of his stories and now we chat pretty much everyday. He's really sweet, smart, funny and sensitive about ongoing issues. I'd describe him as the ""perfect package"". He's such a relief from all the other confusing, douchey guys that really pissed me off last year. He makes me feel extremely happy and doesn't raise any red flags.  I really like this boy so I really hope it doesn't end badly."

After countless rejection letters, second-guessing my worth, spiraling into depression and hurting myself in the process, I did it. I got a job offer today. Not necessarily in ""my field"" of study, but it's something that's related and has upward mobility into an area I'm passionate about. The employer was talking on the phone saying they were so impressed in my interview, and that every interview after just made them more sure they wanted to hire me. It feels good, I can't tell ya'll how shit I felt about myself after getting email after email saying ""While we were impressed, you just weren't the right fit."" Damn it feels good. Like a sliver of hope that I am capable and worth something, my degree wasn't completely worthless and I can impress the right people. I really just cant reiterate how happy and proud I am of myself, I don't have any friends to really celebrate this with, so this is my celebration! Cheers!"

311,"After the worst year of our life, things are finally falling into place for my fianc√© and I.","We moved for his job last spring to California. Things fell apart quickly there as our rental was infested with black widows and roaches, his job was nothing like they said it would be, then my dog passed suddenly after taking a prescription he should have never been on thanks to a new vet. We had to sue to break our lease without negative consequences. Fianc√© quit said job and we moved back to our city in August. His family took us in and had been so nice in the past, but once they found out we got engaged without ""telling"" them, the mother and grandmother became major JustNo's. You can go through to my very first comments on this account for all that jazz. I don't have a family myself, so it's just his. 

My fianc√© kept getting turned down for jobs even though he was overqualified. Then once we thought for sure nothing would happen before Christmas as far as hiring, he gets a call from one of the coolest employers in the area and they've created a position for him because they want to hire him. He went from constantly stressed out being the only manager at his last warehouse to now having an office job that uses all of his experience. He's so happy and I love seeing him this way. He doesn't come home exhausted or stressed and we already have tentative plans to hang out with his co-workers and their partners.

Given all the toxicity in the house we're currently living in, we have been seriously looking for a rental and today got the approval on the one we really, really wanted. It's two blocks from my favorite little square in downtown and a great espresso and whiskey bar that we both love. I'm in shock things have turned around this much in just a month. I'm still coping with the loss of my best friend of 11 years, but I am hopeful for the first time in a really long time.

I adopted a dog who I love dearly and it will be one year with her on Sunday. She keeps me active 3x a day since I don't have a yard and have to take her out to go potty daily.

I've come so far that I am truly grateful for everything. To my ex for being the 1st girlfriend/kiss/everything I ever had. To my parents for sticking with me after I ran away from home and realising they had to change their ways as much as I did mine. To the fact that no matter how much negative self talk I gave myself, I still pushed through to pass my hardest year of medical school yet.

Coming out of a victim mindset and a desperate personality really has changed my life. Instead of ruing mistakes I've learnt from them and realised that I want to live my life with as little regret as possible - to make the best memories I can when looking back on life.

It‚Äôs absolutely nuts because my Mom had just been rear ended a month ago!!!! So I was actually a little scared about her driving my car anyway... she‚Äôs getting older and I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to her.

It reminds me of my little brother back home. 

See, my little bro back home is a freshman in high school, who plays video games... but he doesn't rage quit. When he dies, he laughs. He doesn't stress it, he thinks it's funny how close he got. He's such a cheery guy and his laughter is so contagious. It'll be midnight, and I'll just hear uncontrollable giggling from the next room over. He has no idea how much it makes my night.

347,I‚Äôm getting laid off at my job this week but everything is going to be ok because my spouse is a wonderful partner.,"Back story. When I was a kid both of my parents were pretty severe alcoholics that ended up getting divorced and stayed alcoholics for a very long time. It was hard. I took care of my younger sister a lot, we went to soup kitchens a lot, it sucked. I‚Äôm not mad at my parents or anything, I‚Äôve dealt with those feelings and at least understand why they were like that. But I had gotten so used to taking care of myself and others because that‚Äôs pretty much all I knew. I was dumb and married a guy who basically wanted a mom forever. I worked, he stayed home and did nothing. I cleaned the house, grocery shopped, cooked, managed the bills and whatever else. After realizing that he was not going to change and I deserve better I ended our relationship. For the next few years it was me handling everything in my life and that‚Äôs fine. 

After my spouse and I had been together for awhile he relocated to where I lived and it took a few months to find a job. He managed the house in the meantime so that was nice. He got his dream job and everything has been great. 

Now I‚Äôm getting laid off. Unemployment isn‚Äôt nearly as much I make at my job and there‚Äôs no time frame for when the lay off will end. I feel like I have to jump into action and get this handled by myself ASAP because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done out of necessity. Finding a job that pays well enough in the industry that is doing the lay offs is not an easy task so I‚Äôm panicking. I‚Äôm not going to make enough money. I‚Äôm so fucked. 

Cue the good spouse. I‚Äôm venting to him about my panic and he nonchalantly tells me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt sweat it. We‚Äôll get through this just fine. Together.‚Äù And he means it. He‚Äôs ok with picking up my slack because that‚Äôs what partners do. It feels so good (and so foreign) to actually have someone I can rely on. Someone who can and will actually help. For the first time in so long I feel like I‚Äôm not handling life alone and it‚Äôs comforting."
