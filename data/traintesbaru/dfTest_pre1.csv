60,my depression has always involved a lot of self blame guilt and self hatred as well as anger and emptiness i would always take it out on myself first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill then cutting myself which eventually stemmed into burning scratching and punching walls but recently i have been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past and especially my old school where a lot of very bad events happened to me i am having urges to sneak in one day school is out where i live currently and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything i can find in that shithole,1

77,hey guys so i do not post here often but i suffer from adhd depression and anxiety so long story short i was diagnosed around october although i should have been diagnosed a long while ago so the first thing i went in for was adhd it took me this long to go in for this i am a sophomore in high school mainly because although i could not pay attention i was smart enough to do well if that makes sense and the main reason i actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers but as i got older starting around middle school the material was getting harder so i had to pay attention to do as well as i normally did and then i hit my lowest lows in high school particularly this year,1

82,i am kinda in a mood to tell this story and feel free to put your first cutting deep incident in the comments my first time was in june last year i was cutting a lot at the time although i did not even find it an issue it was just something i did i was cutting my shoulder a lot at the time and i got home from school went into my room grabbed my blade and got to work now this was a blade from a shaving razor i had taken apart it was the sharpest blade in the razor i did not know this at the time so i put the blade to my shoulder and cut i immediately panicked the cut was gaping open and i could see a bit of weird yellow bubbly stuff in it which i later learnt was fat the cut was bleeding a ton so i was trying to stop the bleeding with about a million tissues i knew i needed stitches but i was not about to tell anyone what i had done after about half an hour my mum came into my room to remind me that i had a tutoring lesson and we had to leave i freaked the fuck out my shoulder was still gaping open although the bleeding had slowed down,1

104,i was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars all over both her wrists both her forearms upper arms thighs legs ankles stomach just completely covered in them this got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm and i realised i am that kid i am not completely covered in scars but my ankles are scarred pretty badly my arm which is probably where most people look is covered in cuts scars and burns i do not even hide it anymore because it is so hot i am talking like where i physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out and i am that kid who people will stare at when he is walking to class they might whisper to their friends about my arm the teachers will see my arm and just assume that i am just another emo i do not even do anything in class because i am so depressed that i just do not have the energy to work so i must just look like a massive poser i am always on the lookout for others with scars like mine but there is nobody with them,1
108,went to the er but chickened out at the last minute and told them i was there for stomach pains im currently waiting for test results to come back i know theres nothing wrong with me physically im just such a coward and was afraid of being admitted to inpatient psych again i know my family will be disappointed in me,1

132,i have been through a lot of bullying since kindergarten until last year i am in year now when i was young i was not dealing with the bullying i thought it was normal because it was something that had always been happening but when it got really bad in year i told my parents eventually because i realised i could not go on with it year it began again and then stopped then it returned yet again in year but when i got to year i began realising how to deal with it i have developed many extremely severe mental illnesses from lots of trauma i have experienced and this leads to lots of self hatred and lack of self worth and i used this to my advantage when i was called faggot fuckup fatass gorilla anorexic cutter emo any of it i would laugh and fully agree and even start giving them ideas for insults to give me this threw them back a lot but the physical side of it was still an issue,1
133,i have ptsd associated with an intruder attacking me in my home my therapist believes that i am having emotional regulatory issues now because a boundary was violated and now i have trouble setting up the proper boundaries she wants me to do emdr with another therapist at the practice anyone have experience with this treatment i want to do anything to feel normal again but after reading up on it im a little terrified of having to process the trauma,1

140,i have been diagnosed with both borderline personality disorder as well as ptsd i saw a trauma specialist today for the second time and he said that i might not even have borderline at all and that it could just be really bad ptsd so i am a little confused on what my diagnosis is supposed to be,1
145,when people yell at me or just give me a little bit of attitude it makes me want to cryit makes me wanna bang my head on the wall or something i just start to feel bad,1
148,lately i have lost a lot of weight and have not been eating like i will get hungry but i just do not feel like eating so i will just wait for the hunger pains to go away by themselves i did not really see a problem with this until people started pointing out that they never see me eating and that i am starting to look unhealthily thin even tho i can not really tell if i look thin or not i have been weighing myself daily and my normal weight used to be lbs and i was around that weight pretty consistently for the past few years but lately i have gone down to lbs and i personally have not been able to see the difference if it was not for the people pointing it out but i want to keep losing weight because i want to see the number on the scale get lower i have had anorexia in the past so my mom has been getting worried about me and asking me to eat more because i am starting to look unhealthy again i am not sure what i should do because i do not want to be anorexic again because the recovery processis hell but at the same time i am afraid of gaining weight,1
155,my mental health is all over the place i do not know what illness i have even got anymore i know i have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder both diagnosed by a psychiatrist but i was referred to a psych ward a month ago with a diagnosis of bipolar with psychotic symptoms by the same psychiatrist then when i was there they diagnosed me with psychosis and said they do not think i am bipolar but they also mentioned something about a subtype of schizophrenia i am a year old male if that helps at all basically i have had anxiety issues ever since i was i also had a lot of experience with having auditory hallucinations at the same very young age they went away eventually but my anxiety stayed and began getting worse,1
158,i recently watched black panther and there is a character in that who scars himself for every person he kills this got me thinking about how self harm is shown in movies or tv this guy seemed to just do it as a ritualistic thing although there is a batman villain who cuts himself every time he kills someone and he reveals that he got into it because of the rush it gave him a couple of the main characters from the first ahs season cut one of the main characters from orphan black cuts herself on her back and she is often seen as the more insane character and all this made me realise that self harm is often seen as a very dramatic extreme even insane behaviour,1
163,i am not suicidal but i think about dying a lot and i do think about killing myself not seriously over the smallest things for example today i spilled something and i just thought to myself i could just end it so i do not have to deal with it or if i do not want to do something i am the same way anyone else like this,1
165,and i can not share the news yet because his birthday is not until sunday i am just laying awake very happy because i got an amazing deal rn he is asleep next to me and has no idea now to figure out how to surprise him with the tickets ,0
167,i know what real love is like both from relationships and from family i do not feel that anymore i know i have got anger issues but there are so many things in this world so many harsh comments and looks that i get from people that just make me so angry with everyone i am tired of being expected and pressured to fit into everyone elses mold without question i am tired of being expected to get up and carry everyones baggage and take care of a family who has no clear interest in taking care of me too,1
174,i made my wife carrot cake from scratch for her birthday a year ago this is her sharing with our keekos ,0

181,looking for ptsd buddy i have been having a lot of triggers lately and could use the reassurance of a stranger pm me if you can help,1
192,but goddamn if it doesnt help me so so so much i literally hate going into that office sitting down using the tappers visiting my trauma i hate shaking after i hate the nightmares induced but wow i am already so much more than who i was when i started months ago things are just healing i dont know how to explain it but i am so so proud of myself for doing this i can feel myself loving my spouse more loving strangers more loving myself more,1
199,so i am suffering from intrusive thoughts about suicide last night i was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete i was relatively fine i was sleepy as i was smoking i suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s i got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it it felt real then i tried to calm my self but the thought life is meaningless with somekind of weird future feeling came the strike in the stomach became more intense i immediately went to my room,1
204,i do not hide my arm my scars there range from month to just over a year old the scars are pretty noticeable but i am not attention seeking by not hiding them i simply can not deal with the heat and the uncomfortable feeling of wearing long sleeves while everyone else is comfortably wearing short sleeves and getting people telling me to take my jumper off like they did back when i hid my scars like the plague i have scars on my ankles my thigh my shoulder and my hip as well and i hide my ankle scars and the shoulder thigh and hip scars are hidden easily by my clothes since i am male but i only hide my ankles because they have fresher marks on them when they are older i will not hide them the ones on my thigh are very extreme there are an insane amount of scars and some are quite deep and i refuse to let anyone get a glimpse of my thigh just because the scarring is so severe but my arm which is only moderately scarred i will not hide it is australia it gets extremely hot wearing long sleeves is actually risking my health because of how hot it is so no i am not attention seeking i am just choosing to not give a shit,1
208,i suffer with gad and mdd taken in my baby girl sleeping at the time but this was taken at my most recent darkest time it was the first time i smiled in a long time and i will always treasure this picture,0
209,i am beginning my first major episode since starting my meds and it is making me realise how much i hate this the confusion the paranoia the memory loss the dreams trying to control me the hallucinations the inability to do anything at all i fucking hate it i hate it i hate it so much i hate that i can not do anything i fucking despise this,1
211,i feel so alone and worthless i cant,1
212,we got our marriage license days until i marry my person ,0
213,i often feel like all the parts of my life are very confusing i often get a distorted sense of time i will think it is pm at midnight for example and i often find my sense of reality to be very odd i struggle to know whether or not anything is real and if it is everything seems to blend together into one big slab of time where i am not there like i am watching it happen from somewhere else watching time speed by before my eyes i also tend to have very confused thoughts i will be speaking then suddenly forget what i was saying or even the topic of conversation or who i am talking to or i will just randomly say stuff that makes no sense and i do not know why,1
215,i try my hardest to act like everything is good but it is not i am lonely and miserable i get angry because i am lonely and miserable if i died today i know deep down that i would be forgotten within months not a word about me i know why but it still hurts to know how invaluable i am to everyone i try so hard to fit in to make new friends there is just so much about me that is unlikable and i know that it is not the depression talking i have seen it for myself in peoples eyes and in their body signals i want to live but unemployment depression sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living i can not even see death as an escape there is no escape for this i am going to be a shell no matter what,1
218,ive gained alot of weight after having kids but this picture i do not look awful in i feel pretty and confident always remember no matter how you look it is how you feel about yourself beautiful women of the world,0
220,my cptsd stemmed from long standing and extremely harsh physical sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of my dad i have had some nightmares related to the trauma but as i get more into the therapy and whatnot i have just been having nightmares out of control,1
221,basically i am a guy with many scars on my arm and i am going to need to shave my face at some point so i was wondering if people can refuse to sell me razors if they see my scars,1
227,ive been told by close friends and family that i tend to disassociate but im not really sure if i do or not ive never been told any of this by a psychologist or anyone certified to diagnose also i dont think that ive been in a traumatic event i was in an very toxic romantic relationship not so long ago but it never got to physical abuse it was really emotionally draining and hurtful though,1

235,a few weeks ago i was on a train some guy got on about an hour into the ride of three hours with his girlfriend they sat down and she was being quite loud so i looked over for a second instinctively and he shouted at me i just ignored him and went back to my music over the next half hour however i heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me they were sitting maybe seats in front of me so i could not hear too well he got up after a while to i would assume use the toilet and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me i was quite afraid that he would be getting off at my stop and i was not sure what to do so i held onto my bag securely and started going over all the scenarios in my head that could happen what he wanted and everything like that,1
236,i know the infamy this drug has but in my case it is not doing much of anything i started on mg around a week and a half ago then bumped it up to a few days ago but i am still not feeling much of anything my dreams are slightly more vivid but i am not any more tired i am years old diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and weight just under kilos at just under feet tall do i just keep bumping it up with the all good from my doctors until it starts knocking me out my hallucinations are still just as bad too anyone with experience have any tips,1
247,i am finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death i have very specific means of torture ripping off their noses with channel locks stomping on their face repeatedely cutting all their tendons so they can not even fight back i just imagine myself beating them to the point they are begging to be killed then i would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death after that i would them stare in the eyes and kill them the blood the screams the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness i had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid,1

311,my daily routine lately that has worked wonders also been repeating this mantra as i have severe anxiety dont worry about all of those what ifs things arent a problem until theyre a problem the anxieties over what you might have done wrong or might do wrong or not actual problems that exist yet if they become a problem youll handle and solve them its okay youre all good and youre capable of whatever life throws at you,0
312,i am and my parents are split up anyway i have been really stressed because i do band and sports and school is hard my mom also has obvious favorites so she hates me today i finally told my dad how i feel this was his response first time he is ever told me he was proud of me more in comments,0
318,for me personally my brother is i am and for a while i was not sure if he knew about my depression or anxiety or psychosis or bipolar or anything and he probably thought that our cats really hated me for a while but recently i went to hospital for three weeks and my parents probably told him why my parents are horrible at not telling people about my issues he is fairly absent minded and generally gets easily distracted and i would not be surprised if he did not know what self harm is but i have got scars all over and i have no idea what he thinks happened,1
319,i do not really know what else to say i already have depression anxiety and fucking ptsd and my nutritionist diagnosed me with anorexia and i just feel like a fucking mess right now like at this point it just feels ridiculous that i have so many issues and no i was not misdiagnosed the only one im questioning is the anorexia diagnosis i just feel weird and confused,1

321,absolutely nothing works i have been depressed forever i truly feel like it is impossible for me to live a happy and satisfying life i started losing hope when i started college i had so much optimism going in i thought it would be the best years of my life so far it has not lived up to my expectations at all i have been terribly lonely i am not passionate about my major or anything for that matter,1
326,i have a severe anxiety and panic disorder it makes me super aware of my throat and i feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up i also have gerd this past year i have relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed i am working on therapy after the new year i do not know if it is my head but i am super aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag i do not know if this is my anxiety or gerd or even both but it is incredibly frustrating last winter i saw my doctor and i was gagging so bad in his office that i could barely talk he prescribed me rabeprazole and so i took it for a month or two and then stopped not sure why the gagging is back though and so today i took one i am hoping it does something and i am just thinking it is my anxiety and my head concentrating too much it is just frustrating because it is hard to eat i will be scared of eating and then gag ugh hopefully this made sense,1
327,but people usually are not like that right i think it would be so reassuring if someone loved me that much especially my fp i do not even know what my fp truly thinks of me since he is not as open about his feelings,1
329,i saw a new psychiatrist today to go over a new treatment plan for my ptsd i was prescribed your typical antidepressants klonopin but was also prescribed prazosin mg from my understanding it was initially a blood pressure drug but is also used to help get rid of nightmares for ptsd patients and help me sleep,1
331,for starters i am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and i am constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life it has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping i think if you are religious it can really help you with depression but i just need to find meaning in life and i do not think i could handle doing a job that does not relate to comedy because that is how i find joy in life man that was all over the place,1
332,at work i do not want to be around anyone i do not want to have to talk or force a laugh or make myself smiley like they are used to today i hid away in my office for a majority of the day even brought my work in there so i could sit and listen to my music and break down when i needed to i need to cry i need to breakdown i need to self harm but all of this is impossible because i live at home and my mother has no idea what privacy is,1
334,i feel empty i dont have an appetite i dont want to get out of bed i dont want to breathe i dont have energy to do anything,1
335,ive started trying to write things down more not necessarily journal but just writing down little ideas i have in various notebooks ive come to realize that when my ptsd is in full steam my handwriting is different im known in my familyfriend group for having great penmanship but now the handwriting doesnt even look close to before ill write a thought out and then rip it out of my notebook since it just doesnt look like i wrote it,1

443,like most people here i have experienced significant weight gain since starting seroquel a few months ago to the point where i am considering changing meds i have spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns i have surrounding it but they seem to believe that it is not that bad that i need to gain weight anyway so i might as well let it happen while i do have a thin frame that is a natural thing putting on weight will not make me grow out i will just get a belly and it will not look good not to mention be unhealthy but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain is there anything i can do to change their mind or at least have something to stop the weight gain no matter how much i eat i will put on weight i went a few days without food and still put on weight imnot sure how bad it is going to get and i really need something to help,1

446,after having read about it i am just so disappointed that it is not acknowledged in the dsm for being too similar to ptsd even though from what i read complex ptsd occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting ptsd from that because you developed while surrounded by trauma and cptsd is even acknowledged by the va as a real disorder and i am just confused as to if it is ever going to be acknowledged or not,1
447,me and my girlfriend have been together almost months now and honestly just having her in my life makes everything times easier even when shes annoying the s outta me i cant help but love that girl to pieces im going to marry her not that she knows i think this for sure but shes the girl i want to spend the rest of my life with and personally that makes me happy ,0

479,i dont know how to be happy ive had the most ridiculously incredible life the past year and a half or so and all this happiness led to the ptsd coming out i just cant let myself be happy im supposed to be miserable its all im used to how do i get past this my life is amazing and great and beautiful and i dont want to die anymore but i dont know how to just be chill with it being so happy with my life is scaring the heck out of me,1
486,i dont remember when or why i set it to be that day but it showed up in my phones calendar as a reminder named kill yourself dec th is my th birthday i feel like it was some kind of ultimatum probably for for me to make things better but honestly after seeing that pop up on my phone its made me feel really down because nothing is better i only feel better about things mostly due to sheer ignorance and neglect which in itself makes things worse my circumstances are the same as theyve always been my perspective has changed for the good or bad but when looking at things objectively it makes me want hurt myself as punishment at least ignorance prevents me from suicide,1
487,just started my new classes as a sophomore in high school been struggling with depression and anxiety quite bad this year i have like a group of like ish close friends i like them for the most part but this year especially i make up excuses a lot because i do not feel like doing anything as much as i hate school it at least forced me to socialize with them and be less isolated but with this new quarter i have none of them in any of my classes i feel like this could be detrimental for my mental health and push me into an even worse depressed state and isolate me further as much as i sometimes do not feel like socializing i know it is good for me this is not going to be good,1

512,i know lots of people say that they have no motivation but those people still do things they still function to some degree i just do not i barely leave the house do not bother with school do not bother with any sort of study i just spend my life in bed or in front of a computer screen and i do not ever see that changing until i finally manage to kill myself i have tried many many things over the years to try and help me nothing does shit exercise does not help medication does not help no matter which one i try sleep does not help eating right is something i have always done it does not help meditation or any mindfulness shit makes me worse therapy is just a place for me to realise i am selfish and extremely weak nothing helps i just see no reason in trying anymore for years i hoped it would improve,1
