10," I thought I'd hit my limit a few months ago when I tried to kill myself, but compared to now those times seemed like heaven. I just can't live anymore. You can always say ""it'll get better, don't give up, you're stronger than this,"" that's all bullshit. I'm not strong, if I was strong I wouldn't have covered my whole body in self harm in the space of less than a year, I wouldn't have tried to kill myself, I wouldn't be such a failure, I have a psychologist, a psychiatrist, I'm on meds, my mum's supportive, I still feel the way I do. I'm weak, I'm so weak and useless. I had a horrible cutting incident last night, I carved ""failure"" into my thigh then cut like mad from my thigh all the way up my hip. I cut at least 200 times and I'm planning something similar tonight. I'm so scared. I know what I can do to myself and I'm scared because I know I'll do it. I don't deserve to feel this way.",1

49," My depression has gotten really bad the past year, so much so last week I lost my job. I couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t remember things, I’ve never been able to stay organized, made mistakes, got totally overwhelmed, got behind, got fired. Sigh. Also lost my insurance so I’m weening off the Effexor I’ve been on because I can’t get it anymore. Suffice to say things are not gong well. Now I’m in the awful position of having to look for a job with depression firing on all cylinders. Anything I would want to do (office work, having a computer, ac/heat, nice coworkers) I’m too stupid to do (as evidenced by my last two failed attempts). And the other option, stuff like factory work, makes me miserable. I’ve done it before, constant overtime, weird schedules, “macho” coworkers. I hate it so much.",1

I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me. I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole. ",1

I can't function, I've gotta change schools because I'm just not going to school ever currently, I have no motivation to do anything, I just lie in bed all day wasting away, and I'm only 16. I've covered my body in self harm cuts, burns and scars, I've attempted suicide, I feel so emotionally unstable all the time, one minute I'm extremely depressed then I'll get extremely angry at the smallest of things then I'll go manic without warning and that'll keep happening over and over again, I'm just a huge disappointment. My parents are still together, happy, my mum tries to support me as much as she can, my dad doesn't really understand how I work so he doesn't help me much, but I live in a house, I have food, we might not have all the money we could ever want but we have enough to get by.

So the first thing I went in for was ADHD. It took me this long to go in for this (I'm a sophomore in high school) mainly because although I couldn't pay attention I was smart enough to do well if that makes sense. And the main reason I actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers. But as I got older, starting around middle school, the material was getting harder so I had to pay attention to do as well as I normally did. And then I hit my lowest lows in high school, particularly this year. ",1

82," I'm kinda in a mood to tell this story, and feel free to put your first cutting deep incident in the comments. My first time was in June last year. I was cutting a lot at the time, although I didn't even find it an issue, it was just something I did. I was cutting my shoulder a lot at the time, and I got home from school, went into my room, grabbed my blade and got to work. Now, this was a blade from a shaving razor I had taken apart, it was the sharpest blade in the razor, I didn't know this at the time, so I put the blade to my shoulder and cut. I immediately panicked, the cut was gaping open and I could see a bit of weird yellow bubbly stuff in it, which I later learnt was fat. The cut was bleeding a ton so I was trying to stop the bleeding with about a million tissues, I knew I needed stitches but I wasn't about to tell anyone what I had done. After about half an hour my mum came into my room to remind me that I had a tutoring lesson and we had to leave. I freaked the fuck out, my shoulder was still gaping open, although the bleeding had slowed down.",1

I don’t ever want to have sex. It’s just so scary. I love my spouse and it’s ruining what is otherwise a perfect marriage. I’m in EMDR therapy but god I want to be aroused so fucking bad. I was able to be so in the past when we first started dating, but ever since he’s been my provider I can’t stop being scared. I don’t know what to do.",1
104," I was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars, all over both her wrists, both her forearms, upper arms, thighs, legs, ankles, stomach, just completely covered in them. This got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm, and I realised I'm that kid. I'm not completely covered in scars, but my ankles are scarred pretty badly, my arm, which is probably where most people look, is covered in cuts, scars and burns, I don't even hide it anymore because it's so hot (I'm talking like 42℃, where I physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out), and I'm that kid who people will stare at when he's walking to class, they might whisper to their friends about my arm, the teachers will see my arm and just assume that I'm just another emo, I don't even do anything in class because I'm so depressed that I just don't have the energy to work so I must just look like a massive poser. I'm always on the lookout for others with scars like mine, but there's nobody with them.",1

I'm depressed and at an all time low. My family has disowned me, my daughter doesn't acknowledge I exist, I have no friends, and I can't even find a job. Hope is hollow and love is a lie.",1
132," I've been through a lot of bullying since kindergarten until last year. I'm in year 11 now. When I was young I wasn't dealing with the bullying, I thought it was normal because it was something that had always been happening but when it got really bad in year 6 I told my parents eventually because I realised I couldn't go on with it. Year 7 it began again, and then stopped, then it returned yet again in year 9, but when I got to year 10 I began realising how to deal with it. I have developed many extremely severe mental illnesses from lots of trauma I've experienced and this leads to lots of self hatred and lack of self worth, and I used this to my advantage. When I was called faggot, fuckup, fatass gorilla, anorexic, cutter, emo, any of it, I would laugh and fully agree, and even start giving them ideas for insults to give me. This threw them back a lot, but the physical side of it was still an issue.",1
133, I have PTSD associated with an intruder attacking me in my home.

148," Lately I've lost a lot of weight and haven't been eating, like I'll get hungry but I just don't feel like eating, so I'll just wait for the hunger pains to go away by themselves. I didn't really see a problem with this until people started pointing out that they never see me eating and that I'm starting to look unhealthily thin, even tho I can't really tell if I look thin or not. I've been weighing myself daily and my normal weight used to be 125 lbs. And I was around that weight pretty consistently for the past few years, but lately I've gone down to 110 lbs. And I personally haven't been able to see the difference if it wasn't for the people pointing it out. But I want to keep losing weight, because I want to see the number on the scale get lower. I've had anorexia in the past so my mom has been getting worried about me and asking me to eat more because I'm starting to look unhealthy again. I'm not sure what I should do, because I don't want to be anorexic again because the recovery processis hell, but at the same time I'm afraid of gaining weight.",1
155," My mental health is all over the place, I don't know what illness I've even got anymore. I know I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (both diagnosed by a psychiatrist), but I was referred to a psych ward a month ago with a diagnosis of bipolar 2 with psychotic symptoms by the same psychiatrist, then when I was there they diagnosed me with psychosis and said they don't think I'm bipolar, but they also mentioned something about a subtype of schizophrenia. I'm a 16 year old male if that helps at all. Basically, I've had anxiety issues ever since I was 5, I also had a lot of experience with having auditory hallucinations at the same very young age, they went away eventually but my anxiety stayed and began getting worse.",1
158," I recently watched Black Panther, and there is a character in that who scars himself for every person he kills. This got me thinking about how self harm is shown in movies or TV. This guy seemed to just do it as a ritualistic thing, although there's a batman villain who cuts himself every time he kills someone, and he reveals that he got into it because of the rush it gave him, a couple of the main characters from the first AHS season cut, one of the main characters from Orphan Black cuts herself on her back, and she is often seen as the more insane character, and all this made me realise that self harm is often seen as a very dramatic, extreme, even insane behaviour.",1
163, I'm not suicidal but I think about dying a lot. And I do think about killing myself (not seriously) over the smallest things. For example today I spilled something and I just thought to myself I could just end it so I don't have to deal with it. Or if I don't want to do something I'm the same way. Anyone else like this?,1

204," I don't hide my arm. My scars there range from 1 month to just over a year old.

I have scars on my ankles, my thigh, my shoulder, and my hip as well, and I hide my ankle scars, and the shoulder, thigh and hip scars are hidden easily by my clothes since I'm male, but I only hide my ankles because they have fresher marks on them, when they're older I won't hide them. The ones on my thigh are very extreme, there are an insane amount of scars and some are quite deep, and I refuse to let anyone get a glimpse of my thigh just because the scarring is so severe, but my arm, which is only moderately scarred, I won't hide. It's Australia, it gets extremely hot, wearing long sleeves is actually risking my health because of how hot it is, so no, I'm not attention seeking, I'm just choosing to not give a shit.",1

Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me.

I went out for a few days recently, just me and a couple mates, I felt like absolute shit the entire time, despite getting a good 9 hours of sleep, eating well and getting out a lot. In fact, when I got home I cut myself that night and actually came quite close to an overdose the next morning. Despite this, I just know people will still babble on that I'm just not trying hard enough, and that exercise will be my saviour, despite me being severely depressed while doing soccer and tennis weekly and also working as a referee a couple years ago.",1

318," For me personally my brother is 13, I'm 16, and for a while I wasn't sure if he knew about my depression or anxiety or psychosis or bipolar or anything, and he probably thought that our cats really hated me for a while, but recently I went to hospital for three weeks and my parents probably told him why (my parents are horrible at not telling people about my issues).

I am not passionate about my major, or anything for that matter.",1
326, I have a severe anxiety and panic disorder. It makes me super aware of my throat and I feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up. I also have GERD. This past year i've relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed. I'm working on therapy after the New Year. I don't know if it's my head but I am SUPER aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag. I don't know if this is my anxiety or GERD or even both but it's incredibly frustrating. Last winter I saw my doctor and I was gagging so bad in his office that I could barely talk. He prescribed me Rabeprazole and so I took it for a month or two and then stopped. Not sure why. The gagging is back though and so today I took one. I'm hoping it does something and I'm just thinking it's my anxiety and my head concentrating too much. It's just frustrating because it's hard to eat. I'll be scared of eating and then gag. Ugh. Hopefully this made sense.,1

331, For starters I am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and I'm constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life. It has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping. I think if you are religious it can really help you with depression. But I just need to find meaning in life and I don't think I could handle doing a job that doesn't relate to comedy because that is how I find joy in life. Man that was all over the place...,1
332, At work I don't want to be around anyone. I don't want to have to talk or force a laugh or make myself smiley like they are used to. Today I hid away in my office for a majority of the day.

I need to self harm but all of this is impossible because I live at home and my mother has no idea what privacy is.,1

Ever since I was fired I’ve felt completely paralyzed on where to go from here. I have no college, no skills, nothing. I’ve worked two kinds of jobs, factories and offices. I could never keep up with the office jobs (see above), and factories make me MISERABLE. It’s nothing against that kind of work, it’s me.

I've spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns I have surrounding it, but they seem to believe that it's not that bad, that I need to gain weight anyway so I might as well let it happen. While I do have a thin frame, that's a natural thing, putting on weight won't make me grow out, I'll just get a belly and it won't look good, not to mention be unhealthy, but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain. Is there anything I can do to change their mind, or at least have something to stop the weight gain?

Yet, 5 minutes into it's baking time, the crust burns. I lost it. I know I shouldn't have and I know that it's literally a crust, but I couldn't stand it.",1
604, I have been in a horrible pattern of insomnia for a few weeks now. I can’t get out of it. My psychiatrist had to take an emergency extended leave so I don’t have a doctor at the moment. My prescription of Klonopin 2mg/daily ran out and I’m pretty sure I just went through a withdrawal from it because I spent the last few days feeling dead.,1

609," My issue is that negative automatic thoughts take over and I can't get away from them. I get trapped in them and believe that they are the truth. It's like I'm possessed Exorcist-style. Examples: I don't deserve good things, I deserve to be criticized, I have no valuable skills, etc.",1

616, When my ex and I broke up I lost 50 pounds due to not eating. Not eating was the only control that I felt I had. I became obsessed with losing more weight. I’ve gain a lot of it back now but a few days ago I tried vomiting what I ate. I just feel like what I put into my body is the only sense of control that I have left. Do you think this is the beginning of an eating disorder? If so what should I do? Thanks for any advice.,1

620, I literally can hardly get myself to school in the mornings and end up staying home more often than I should. If I can actually get myself there I'm alright (although still depressed of course but I can usually make it through the day then). Anyone else like this we're just getting up is the hardest part?,1

627," I posted on here recently about how I was choked by a student at work (I work with students with autism) and thought I might have developed PTSD... Well, Monday I was officially diagnosed. Tuesday night the anxiety got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. It has become this incredibly overwhelming situation because of all the insurance stuff and the many different health care providers involved, some of whom are worker's comp and some of whom aren't. People are suggesting I get an attorney. I have no family nearby. I'm almost out of money and I don't know how much I'll get paid this month because I've missed so much work, so I don't even know that I'm going to be able to afford to get to all of my doctor and therapy appointments (I don't drive due to a medical condition, so I pretty much have to take lyft/uber to all my appointments), let alone pay rent or buy food.",1

644, Sometimes I feel like what happened to me isn't bad enough to have PTSD. But sometimes it feels like the straw that broke the camel's back. I think what happened caused PTSD because I was already not in a good mental health place. Please seek help if you're in that place. Its not to little to need help.,1
