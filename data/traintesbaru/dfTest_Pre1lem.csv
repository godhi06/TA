158,i recently watched black panther and there is a character in that who scar himself for every person he kill this got me thinking about how self harm is shown in movie or tv this guy seemed to just do it a a ritualistic thing although there is a batman villain who cut himself every time he kill someone and he reveals that he got into it because of the rush it gave him a couple of the main character from the first ahs season cut one of the main character from orphan black cut herself on her back and she is often seen a the more insane character and all this made me realise that self harm is often seen a a very dramatic extreme even insane behaviour,1
163,i am not suicidal but i think about dying a lot and i do think about killing myself not seriously over the smallest thing for example today i spilled something and i just thought to myself i could just end it so i do not have to deal with it or if i do not want to do something i am the same way anyone else like this,1

321,absolutely nothing work i have been depressed forever i truly feel like it is impossible for me to live a happy and satisfying life i started losing hope when i started college i had so much optimism going in i thought it would be the best year of my life so far it ha not lived up to my expectation at all i have been terribly lonely i am not passionate about my major or anything for that matter,1
326,i have a severe anxiety and panic disorder it make me super aware of my throat and i feel gaggy when my anxiety flare up i also have gerd this past year i have relapsed into really bad panic attack which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed i am working on therapy after the new year i do not know if it is my head but i am super aware of my throat all the time which then cause me to gag i do not know if this is my anxiety or gerd or even both but it is incredibly frustrating last winter i saw my doctor and i wa gagging so bad in his office that i could barely talk he prescribed me rabeprazole and so i took it for a month or two and then stopped not sure why the gagging is back though and so today i took one i am hoping it doe something and i am just thinking it is my anxiety and my head concentrating too much it is just frustrating because it is hard to eat i will be scared of eating and then gag ugh hopefully this made sense,1
