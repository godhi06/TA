264," Anyone else drown in self pity when they are going through a bout of depression? I'm in depression and I know that about myself is a really bad habit. I normally will drown in self pity when I'm depressed. I know it accomplishes nothing and probably makes things worse if anything. But I still do it and I don't know why, part of me thinks I do it for validation of how I feel.",1
259, I have PTSD from being attacked by an intruder to my home. Now whenever I am upstairs and home alone I hear someone downstairs. Ive ran downstairs to look multiple times and no one is ever there. Is this part of the flashbacks from PTSD? Does anyone else experience this kind of half flashback half reality?,1

It only happens if I've been at a bad low for a really long time and I've been really inactive, probably laying in bed bc my body is aching so bad.

250," I'm finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death. I have very specific means of torture. Ripping off their noses with channel locks. Stomping on their face repeatedely, cutting all their tendons so they can't even fight back. I just imagine myself beating them to the point they're begging to be killed. Then I would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death. After that I would them stare in the eyes and kill them. The blood, the screams, the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness. I had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid.",1
131," I've been told by several different sources that sometimes my eyes look ""dull"" or ""lifeless"". I was FaceTiming with my boyfriend and I couldn't help but notice it the whole time. They look dark and lack emotion even though my facial expressions do the opposite. Meanwhile his eyes (which are a darker color than mine) looked like they were shining and I could see how much he adores me just by looking at them. And now I'm worried he thinks I hate him or something, bc eyes are so telling. They're what we look at to know what someone is feeling.",1

Now she’s cancelling my appointments, leaving me for 4 weeks without therapy, causing large gaps in my mental health treatment. I feel like I can’t get better this way.

490," My PTSD is caused by many traumas I dealt with in school, because of this going to school is nearly impossible, I get shakes, sweaty, I get horrible memories swirling around in my head over and over, I become paranoid, delusional, feel unsafe and like someone is going to hurt me, I hear voices that aren't there, I just cannot deal with it. Last year when I was attending school regularly, I would cut and burn myself every single day, many times, I tried to hang myself, I had breakdowns constantly, I ended up in a psych ward where I was told my depression had gotten so bad I was psychotic, all because of school. The very idea of having to go horrifies me, I haven't been in about 8 or 9 weeks, and I haven't tried to kill myself and I'm only cutting a couple of times a week, but I know my lack of attendance will come back to haunt me at some point.",1
448," Like most people here, I've experienced significant weight gain since starting Seroquel a few months ago, to the point where I'm considering changing meds. I've spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns I have surrounding it, but they seem to believe that it's not that bad, that I need to gain weight anyway so I might as well let it happen. While I do have a thin frame, that's a natural thing, putting on weight won't make me grow out, I'll just get a belly and it won't look good, not to mention be unhealthy, but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain. Is there anything I can do to change their mind, or at least have something to stop the weight gain? No matter how much I eat I'll put on weight, I went a few days without food and still put on weight, I'mnot sure how bad it's going to get and I really need something to help.",1

I don't even know what class I'm meant to be in right now, I'm just so fed up with everything, I just don't have the energy to try and put the effort in anymore. I just feel so fucking empty, and I feel like there's no point to any of this. Why should I show up to class if it doesn't even matter in the lifetime of the universe? So I might get detention, or suspended, or expelled. Who cares. I'm only year eleven and my life has fallen apart and I can't seem to put it back together again.",1
421," Just curious if anyone has felt this or can relate to this. Long story short I lost my job at the start of they year (poor performances, disorganized, etc), second in a row. Finally went to the behavioral health place in town and was diagnosed with Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. Great. Ever since I was fired I’ve felt completely paralyzed on where to go from here. I have no college, no skills, nothing. I’ve worked two kinds of jobs, factories and offices. I could never keep up with the office jobs (see above), and factories make me MISERABLE. It’s nothing against that kind of work, it’s me. Overtime, overnights, the danger, everything about it for some reason made me so sad I couldn’t stand it.",1
364,"My happy Sunday morning experience

With the storm in the UK being in full swing this morning I got up with the dreaded Sunday feeling and a slight hangover.

I looked out the window and saw the rain coming in sideways and battering the road below. In the distance I saw a couple dressed head to toe in waterproofs and looking pretty miserable. At their feet I saw a black Labrador who was having the best day ever!!!

10," I thought I'd hit my limit a few months ago when I tried to kill myself, but compared to now those times seemed like heaven. I just can't live anymore. You can always say ""it'll get better, don't give up, you're stronger than this,"" that's all bullshit. I'm not strong, if I was strong I wouldn't have covered my whole body in self harm in the space of less than a year, I wouldn't have tried to kill myself, I wouldn't be such a failure, I have a psychologist, a psychiatrist, I'm on meds, my mum's supportive, I still feel the way I do. I'm weak, I'm so weak and useless. I had a horrible cutting incident last night, I carved ""failure"" into my thigh then cut like mad from my thigh all the way up my hip. I cut at least 200 times and I'm planning something similar tonight. I'm so scared. I know what I can do to myself and I'm scared because I know I'll do it. I don't deserve to feel this way.",1

Not my family, not my friends, absolutely nobody except my best friend, and I'm still not sure how I care about him. This never used to bother me until I recently realised just how lonely this is. Having nobody to care about, nobody to genuinely laugh with and enjoy their company.

That talk was over a month ago and I thought she'd be over what I said by now. In my opinion, it really wasn't that bad and any feelings I have towards her have been buried deep because she's now in a relationship. The relationship doesn't bother me at all but I feel like what I said to her did and I'm completely confused because she asked me to say it.

558," What's probably a really stupid thought just came to me. A few minutes ago I was sitting on the couch in my back room and burnt my calf with a lighter. My dog was lying on his bed watching me and when I looked at him he looked kind of confused. I don't want him suddenly thinking that fire is okay and safe because he saw me cooking my leg, can animals tell that something's wrong if they see someone doing it?",1
319," I'm 13 and I have been hearing thought-like voices for some time now. I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and am on Zoloft. I have a therapist too. I also cut. The voice curses a lot and tells me that I'm worthless and stupid. I can't stop it talking once it starts it only goes away when it wants. Als o, I wish on everything and strongly believe it will come true, and I get mad at the 'wish gods' or 'stars' when they don't.

329, I have a severe anxiety and panic disorder. It makes me super aware of my throat and I feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up. I also have GERD. This past year i've relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed. I'm working on therapy after the New Year. I don't know if it's my head but I am SUPER aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag. I don't know if this is my anxiety or GERD or even both but it's incredibly frustrating. Last winter I saw my doctor and I was gagging so bad in his office that I could barely talk. He prescribed me Rabeprazole and so I took it for a month or two and then stopped. Not sure why. The gagging is back though and so today I took one. I'm hoping it does something and I'm just thinking it's my anxiety and my head concentrating too much. It's just frustrating because it's hard to eat. I'll be scared of eating and then gag. Ugh. Hopefully this made sense.,1
176, I have been playing football since 7th grade and I would say I have wanted to quit since the beginning of 9th. I already thought it wasn't worth all the time you put in but now with depression I have no desire what so ever. A big problem here is my coaches really like me and I dread having to deal with them and also more importantly my dad is an 8th grade FB coach and would HATE if I were to quit. I just really don't enjoy it at all anymore and it makes getting up for school even harder when we're in season. That's the other thing like we're not even in season I try to pride myself on not quitting in the middle of things so it shouldn't be as big of a deal to him. I don't know just thinking about it makes me more depressed... I am a sophomore right now and I don't think I can take 2 more years of football,1

I would sometimes get physically sick over my own feelings, wouldn't be able to stop thinking about that person, etc. I even figured out where one boy lived when I was still in elementary school, and I would constantly ride my bike in front of his house hoping he'd notice me.",1
101," I just wanted to say thank you for the support I received here a couple weeks ago when I was in an extremely dark place.

Then I need to write a note that will help any family I have to move on. I know I won't be able to prevent grief entirely but I can help mitigate it. Is there anything else that i haven't thought of? Or advice for any of the tasks I have? How do I even break a relationship off when we live together. Even if I can't die I need to do something because I can see how much I hurt my partner just by being so depressed all the time.,1

Also lost my insurance so I’m weening off the Effexor I’ve been on because I can’t get it anymore. Suffice to say things are not gong well. Now I’m in the awful position of having to look for a job with depression firing on all cylinders. Anything I would want to do (office work, having a computer, ac/heat, nice coworkers) I’m too stupid to do (as evidenced by my last two failed attempts).

For years I correlated being in a relationship with having no autonomy over myself, my thoughts, needs, and feelings don't matter, and that I am completely powerless. But yesterday I realized that I have these beliefs because my brain had equated the abuse I faced as a child, to what being in a relationship will be like. As a kid, I remember having this deep feeling of dread at the thought of ever being in a relationship because I thought any kind of romantic relationship in the future would just mean a continuation of what was happening to me at the time, and meant that I'd lose ownership over myself again and be completely powerless.",1

I was cutting a lot at the time, although I didn't even find it an issue, it was just something I did. I was cutting my shoulder a lot at the time, and I got home from school, went into my room, grabbed my blade and got to work. Now, this was a blade from a shaving razor I had taken apart, it was the sharpest blade in the razor, I didn't know this at the time, so I put the blade to my shoulder and cut. I immediately panicked, the cut was gaping open and I could see a bit of weird yellow bubbly stuff in it, which I later learnt was fat. The cut was bleeding a ton so I was trying to stop the bleeding with about a million tissues, I knew I needed stitches but I wasn't about to tell anyone what I had done. After about half an hour my mum came into my room to remind me that I had a tutoring lesson and we had to leave. I freaked the fuck out, my shoulder was still gaping open, although the bleeding had slowed down.",1

So the first thing I went in for was ADHD. It took me this long to go in for this (I'm a sophomore in high school) mainly because although I couldn't pay attention I was smart enough to do well if that makes sense. And the main reason I actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers.

Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me.

So, ever since, I've been hoping that my ""stupidness"" problems that are caused by depression will eventually go away but I've been on antidepressants and therapy for months. The main doctor there said I would feel the full effects of my antidepressent Welbutrin after a month, but it's been 7 months now and I'm honestly no different than before.

How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and I’m desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.",1

83," Depression was barely even on my radar, I knew it existed but I didn't think it was common or that I would ever deal with it. I don't even know what I thought depression was, I might have just thought ""oh, you're just sad a lot."" Now I know how wrong I was.",1

632," I posted on here recently about how I was choked by a student at work (I work with students with autism) and thought I might have developed PTSD... Well, Monday I was officially diagnosed. Tuesday night the anxiety got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. It has become this incredibly overwhelming situation because of all the insurance stuff and the many different health care providers involved, some of whom are worker's comp and some of whom aren't. People are suggesting I get an attorney. I have no family nearby. I'm almost out of money and I don't know how much I'll get paid this month because I've missed so much work, so I don't even know that I'm going to be able to afford to get to all of my doctor and therapy appointments (I don't drive due to a medical condition, so I pretty much have to take lyft/uber to all my appointments), let alone pay rent or buy food.",1

338," I’ve started trying to write things down more. Not necessarily journal but just writing down little ideas I have in various notebooks. I’ve come to realize that when my PTSD is in full steam, my handwriting is different. I’m known in my family/friend group for having great penmanship. But now, the handwriting doesn’t even look close to before. I’ll write a thought out and then rip it out of my notebook since it just doesn’t look like I wrote it.",1
473," I was diagnosed with panic related agoraphobia a decade ago but it wasn't as bad as this past year when I experienced the worst panic attack of my life. It spiraled into health anxiety and trips to the ER for my panic attacks, self harm relapses ect. Then I had family stress added on top of it. I haven't left the house in almost a month and that was just to the pharmacy and I was anxious and out of it with derealization the whole time. Only wanted to get back home. I have a fear of being anxious in public. I can't handle it. Anyone else?",1

I had friends over for the Super Bowl. It wasnât stressful, I had a good time, and I truly felt like the people that came over wanted to be there. 

Iâm constantly stuck inside my head and worry constantly about the dumbest things. I also have trouble seeing the forest from the trees. 

Itâs been a long time since Iâve felt this âsatisfiedâ I guess. Iâm truly happy right now and I donât want to forget this.",0

137," I'm trying to learn how to program and it involves a lot of reading/reasoning/and just doing things very fast. I've noticed that I have a lot of difficulty distinguishing true and false, which is the fundamentals of programming. When I come across something like ""not false"" my brain/thoughts just freeze. I notice this too when doing driving school lessons, the instructor would say turn right or left and I'd get confused sometimes doing the opposite or I would understand him but not quickly, like there's a 1 second delay between him saying turn left and me understanding that he said turn left and I need to turn left.",1
