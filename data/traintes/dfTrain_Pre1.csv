447,after having read about it i am just so disappointed that it is not acknowledged in the dsm for being too similar to ptsd even though from what i read complex ptsd occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting ptsd from that because you developed while surrounded by trauma and cptsd is even acknowledged by the va as a real disorder and i am just confused as to if it is ever going to be acknowledged or not,1,94

154,my fp is studying and doing homework really intensely today and he communicated with me that he needed to turn off his phone to focus better but that he would talk to me later but after that i noticed he was active on fb for a bit it is slightly bothering me which is so stupid i know but whenever something slightly bothers me it just progressively gets worse until i split and do something i regret i do not want to bother him and seem crazy i do not wanna stress him out but a part of me is so convinced he just does not want to talk to me or he is getting sick of me or he is talking to someone else my paranoia is probably one of my most intense bpd traits i do not know how to get past it,1,145
126,i have really spotty memory but for some reason i can always reexperience how i felt during a certain time period or event even if i cant remember anything else about it it is like i only have memories in the form of the emotions i felt during it and the emotional responses i have to the things i try to remember a lot of the time i am left having to piece everything back together around my emotional memory just to get a sense of what actually happened,1,89
409,i am glad people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about their problems but i seriously need a break i am also tired of my family acting like i can not be upset or annoyed with them i am not a therapist a guidance counselor or a life coach i can not help you like they can it is good to tell someone how you feel but i cannot handle everyones emotional baggage when i am still trying to fix myself,1,82

173,it never stops and it is quite bothersome my gut feeling tells me that people always have an issue with me but they say different meanwhile it feels like they are trying to force themselves to be nice with me on one hand i want to give them the benefit of the doubt and keep them as friends on the other hand i am afraid that they are just messing with me for a laugh and therefore i want to let them go i have no idea what to do or how to get rid of this feeling inside of me,1,101

17,i have been stuck with my problems for so long that communicating them is difficult i have almost nobody i can candidly talk to about what i am feeling except for this guy i met here on reddit almost years ago he knows all i have been going through i vent to him sometimes but i really do not want to bother him too much so i have cut back a lot i would not count on him as a super reliable friend he tends to leave my messages on read to end the conversation and there is also a sexual aspect to our relationship i do not quite count him as a friend as most of our communication is through text although we met in person times years ago we do not talk frequently so it often feels like i am alone,1,143
356,i have this weird habit of staring at my inner forearm in public and at home the scars there are probably about months to just over a year old and i kind of like the way they look which is probably weird but especially for me because whenever i look at the scars on my outer forearm i hate them for being so visible and still so red after six months of healing but the scars on my inner forearm almost satisfy me they are not even very deep at all nothing compared to my thigh but i like staring at them anyway,1,103

180,when i started to feel more normal i was still highly anxious and i dont know over what but since the episode this morning ive developed this weird tick that i cant stop i keep clenching my jaw pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth and like sucking my cheeks in almost like im imitating a fish its been hours since its started and i genuinely cant get it to stop its been so bad that my tongue is actually really starting to hurt has this happened to anyone else before,1,93
301,i was watching degrassi recently and a character was in the hospital for having what they thought oppositional defiant disorder i looked it up out of curiosity and it seemed way close to what i actually have well the mood swing part i feel like even after all these years i can not control myself and when i am having these episodes i can get really scary i get even worse when someone either laughs tries to argue with me or insists that i am a liar it is like it sets me off into this free range beast that has lost all morals and would love nothing than to see and feel the world burn,1,116
440,i was waiting at a bus stop with my sleeves rolled up and some old guy looked about and pretty high came up to me and said i looked like a muso i laughed and said i was and then he looked at my arm and said you have got a fair few scars there have not you i just laughed like they were nothing and then he said i have got my fair share of scars too he began indicating to areas he had scars i figured he was just reminiscing about the old days and those scars he got taking apart a railroad or some shit when he indicated to his fingers and said got the letters e z on these did it with a knife on a cutting board,1,132
645,sometimes i feel like what happened to me is not bad enough to have ptsd but sometimes it feels like the straw that broke the camels back i think what happened caused ptsd because i was already not in a good mental health place please seek help if you are in that place its not to little to need help,1,60

487,i dont remember when or why i set it to be that day but it showed up in my phones calendar as a reminder named kill yourself dec th is my th birthday i feel like it was some kind of ultimatum probably for for me to make things better but honestly after seeing that pop up on my phone its made me feel really down because nothing is better i only feel better about things mostly due to sheer ignorance and neglect which in itself makes things worse my circumstances are the same as theyve always been my perspective has changed for the good or bad but when looking at things objectively it makes me want hurt myself as punishment at least ignorance prevents me from suicide,1,128
5,does anyone know when the proper time is to go to the hospital ive been super depressed and suicidal lately there are moments when it gets really intense and i feel i will follow through with it its gotten to the point where i call the suicide hotline every day because i dont know what else to do,1,58
45,i am not entirely sure how this would even work but imagine like a typical razor blade but made out of like a hard sort of rubber and when you used it on yourself it would create sort of fake blood in a line and would look like you cut i am trying to find cutting distractions rn and this would be so amazing i feel probably making no sense sorry and it probably sounds dumb but if it was possible that would be something amazing to be sold for recovering cutters to buy just a dumb idea soz,1,99

16,hi i was attacked by an intruder to my home a few months ago my therapist diagnosed me with moderate ptsd my landlords matience man is very bad about knocking and announcing himself when he comes over she notifies us a week ahead of time but with huge windows on when he can stop by for example he will be over mondaythursday if we arent home he opens the rental with the key the problem is he knocks on the back door once our back door has an entryway therefore you cannot hear a knock anywhere in the house from that door,1,102

625,i was talking to my psychologist about some fairly annoying hallucinations i have been having a ton of recently mostly stuff like constantly hearing a tv or a radio seeing people coming towards me when i am on a walk but then vanishing when they get close or hearing someone walking around my house chatting away and she seemed pretty bothered that my medication is not stopping them as much as it should they are definitely not as bad as they were when i was unmediated but they still bother me regularly and it made me wonder if this is normal or if my medication should be blocking them more than it is what kind of hallucinations do you all have on medication should i look into changing my meds up or is this normal,1,135
590,for me work is not on the table for a while i am in my final year of school once i am done i am going to uni but with my disorder i can barely manage one thing but once i am done with uni i might look into work problem is i do not know where to start i am thinking something simple and part time but even getting a part time job needs a lot of things i just can not do for those of you who work how did you start out,1,95

551,i have held a schizophrenia diagnosis for over a year now with my first psychosis being diagnosed almost years ago since then the people who know namely my family expect me to function exactly the same as if i was healthy even if i am in the middle of an extremely intense episode now a week ago i injured my knee my kneecap dislodged basically dislocated out of the blue quickly popped back in went to see my gp the next day and it happened again i am on crutches now since i can not walk on it and i am getting scans done it is likely that the recovery period will be a number of months with surgery playing a part since then everyone seems to be much more worried nobody expects me to be up and out of the house constantly nobody expects me to be fully functional and operating perfectly normally even though this knee is bothering me much less than my schizophrenia does on any given day and any psychotic episode is miles worse than not being able to walk and it is really quite depressing how little people care about anything mental health related,1,199

309,so i am a male i am and i was thinking today bad idea i know i was thinking about the previous school i was at and i remembered something quite traumatic that happened to me in year when i was i am not sure how i did not remember this until now but it is possible that my brain forced me to forget it okay so in year i had really terrible anxiety and that made me an easy bullying target and i was bullied very badly but one kid in particular went a bit overboard i sat next to this kid i will call him angus i sat next to angus in history due to our seating arrangement and every lesson he would make sexual actions towards me it started off mild like he would just say quietly that he wanted to kiss me or sleep with me creepy shit like that but then it got worse he began to touch me quite inappropriately,1,166
193,but goddamn if it doesnt help me so so so much i literally hate going into that office sitting down using the tappers visiting my trauma i hate shaking after i hate the nightmares induced but wow i am already so much more than who i was when i started months ago things are just healing i dont know how to explain it but i am so so proud of myself for doing this i can feel myself loving my spouse more loving strangers more loving myself more,1,88

407,so i have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a severe generalized anxiety disorder but i have been having some symptoms over the last year and a half that do not seem to fit into those categories i have been experiencing a very extreme fluctuating mood i can go from feeling extremely elated and invincible having so many thoughts and ideas running through my head talking very fast having extreme amounts of energy and feeling oddly irritated with people to feeling horribly depressed and empty i am extremely impulsive which has lead to me basically covering my body in self harm cuts and scars in less than a year along with just randomly tying a noose up and hanging myself not even necessarily because i really want to be dead but just to see if i will die this time,1,141

134,i have ptsd associated with an intruder attacking me in my home my therapist believes that i am having emotional regulatory issues now because a boundary was violated and now i have trouble setting up the proper boundaries she wants me to do emdr with another therapist at the practice anyone have experience with this treatment i want to do anything to feel normal again but after reading up on it im a little terrified of having to process the trauma,1,81

597,ugh so back in january i got fired from my job because i was too stupid and made a mess of it more on that in a minute since that was the second time thats happened i decided to try and get help from the behavioral health place in town took a psychological evaluation and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and adhd it also showed my executive functioning was severely deficient and that im likely asocial i met with a psychiatrist who wants to start with adhd meds and go from there im actually kinda proud of myself for trying to get help but it doesnt change the fact that im a year old unemployed loser with no college no skills no talents and no hope,1,130
230,selfexplanatory i guess i am just venting here dunno what else to do graduated from a top university last year thought it will finally get better quite the opposite in fact had a pretty messy breakup with a girl who i thought i would spend the rest of my life with worked in a startup for a bit but absolutely hated it so left and came back home to london living with parents is so much worse than i initially thought ended up going to therapy but that did not help either,1,92

40,i have diagnosed ptsd depression and anxiety i have been on prozac seroquel and xanax for the last few months ive been struggling more the last few weeks especially with dissociation and anxiety today my psychiatrist switched me from mg of xanax a day to mg of klonopin up to theyre dissolvable tablets she also switched my seroquel from mg a day to mg a day my prozac remains the same at mg a day im nervous about trying klonopin because i dont know anything about it really ive only been on xanax throughout the years is there any major difference doubling the dose of seroquel doesnt make me too nervous but something about the switch to klonopin does any advice is appreciated,1,123

455,because of my depression i often do not want to do anything with any of my friends and often times when they text in the group chat if we wanna hang i do not respond i do not want to do anything like i said but at the same time i feel so shitty when i do not get invited or get left out it is understandable why they do not invite me sometimes i get it anyone else like this,1,81
644,in his videos about self injury not only does he almost completely ignore all forms of self harm except for cutting but he generalises all self harmers to be attention seekers constantly stating that its only white privileged upper class girls who cut which shames those people who self harm who fit that description and makes people like me who do not fit that description feel alienated and fake he calls self harmers morons crazy psychopaths idiots fuckups and says that people with real problems do not self harm using two pictures of people in a bad position to generalize that absolutely nobody whos in an extremely bad state self harms he ignores all statistics proving that african americans are found by multiple studies to be the most likely to self injure and says instead that because tumblr is mostly white people all self harmers must be white people he repeatedly says that all self harmers are idiots for not getting therapy again generalising that none of us are in therapy and then he puts us down so much that for me at least he made me feel like i did not deserve help making me self harm much more much worse ending in a suicide attempt and hospitalisation,1,209

105,i was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars all over both her wrists both her forearms upper arms thighs legs ankles stomach just completely covered in them this got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm and i realised i am that kid i am not completely covered in scars but my ankles are scarred pretty badly my arm which is probably where most people look is covered in cuts scars and burns i do not even hide it anymore because it is so hot i am talking like where i physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out and i am that kid who people will stare at when he is walking to class they might whisper to their friends about my arm the teachers will see my arm and just assume that i am just another emo i do not even do anything in class because i am so depressed that i just do not have the energy to work so i must just look like a massive poser i am always on the lookout for others with scars like mine but there is nobody with them,1,220

205,i do not hide my arm my scars there range from month to just over a year old the scars are pretty noticeable but i am not attention seeking by not hiding them i simply can not deal with the heat and the uncomfortable feeling of wearing long sleeves while everyone else is comfortably wearing short sleeves and getting people telling me to take my jumper off like they did back when i hid my scars like the plague i have scars on my ankles my thigh my shoulder and my hip as well and i hide my ankle scars and the shoulder thigh and hip scars are hidden easily by my clothes since i am male but i only hide my ankles because they have fresher marks on them when they are older i will not hide them the ones on my thigh are very extreme there are an insane amount of scars and some are quite deep and i refuse to let anyone get a glimpse of my thigh just because the scarring is so severe but my arm which is only moderately scarred i will not hide it is australia it gets extremely hot wearing long sleeves is actually risking my health because of how hot it is so no i am not attention seeking i am just choosing to not give a shit,1,227

427,for about as long as i can remember i have considered myself a staunch advocate for mental health care and the rights of people suffering from mental illness these sorts of issues have always been part of my life in some way i had an uncle who committed suicide before i was born my father was in the military and while he got out when i was still pretty young he was left with a traumatic brain injury chronic back pain severe depression and ptsd when i was in middle school he developed a dependency on alcohol that remains with him to this day my mother had a tumultuous childhood that was marked by poverty and abuse her father and stepmother were both violent alcoholics her mother died when she was years old,1,133
454,i am aware i have depression so some of these thoughts may not make any sense but i just want to describe how i feel and i feel angry disappointed ashamed and you know if i told my therapist or doctors how i feel their immediate response would be oh it is just your depression but then when their are reasons underlying why i feel this way it can not just simply be symptoms of chemical imbalances i would not want to die if my brain was fucked and everything around me was fine but it seems my brain is fucked and everything is fucked,1,105

20,my illness tends to present itself in a more delusional manner with hallucinations being more scattered and nonsensical but they are quite infrequent however i occasionally suffer from periods where they spike hugely but they are all disconnected from each other i just saw a dog run past when i was getting a bottle of water from the fridge then began seeing a flashing light above me and then when i walked down the hall i heard a voice sounding kind of staticy coming from my brothers room all of these happened within a second period should i be worried i have had periods like this before and i am not particularly bothered by hallucinations unless they are keeping me awake or interfering with something i need to be doing my delusions are much worse but is there any way to avoid these little hallucination episodes,1,146
