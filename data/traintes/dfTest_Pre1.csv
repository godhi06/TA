60,my depression has always involved a lot of self blame guilt and self hatred as well as anger and emptiness i would always take it out on myself first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill then cutting myself which eventually stemmed into burning scratching and punching walls but recently i have been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past and especially my old school where a lot of very bad events happened to me i am having urges to sneak in one day school is out where i live currently and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything i can find in that shithole,1,119
